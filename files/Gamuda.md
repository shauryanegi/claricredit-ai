Understandably, a key question arises about Gamuda's strategy for sustaining such robust growth. Our steady performance across various markets stems from years of experience in the countries where we operate, giving us invaluable local knowledge and cultural understanding. Success is only earned through lessons learned over decades, helping us mitigate risks and manage change while safeguarding our margins. We've honed our ability to leverage our strengths in diverse markets, creating mutual benefits for both Gamuda and our clients.

In addition, innovation driven by talent and technology application continues to be our competitive advantage, spurring us forward in the industry. Our objective is to enhance our chances for successful growth in revenue and earnings as well. By focusing on these vital elements, we have managed to position ourselves for sustainable expansion and increased profitability in the long-term.

We have achieved strong topline revenue, healthy earnings growth, and expansive growth in market capitalisation over the last five years. This is a result from how the Group has done things differently and effectively in the past.

**Dear Shareholders,** 

**Since Gamuda's inception in 1976, we have consistently grown from strength to strength. In recent years, we have strategically expanded our operations into markets suited to our strengths. We are grateful for our success in securing and completing projects thus far. Our regional expansion, which today is a key component of our business strategy, has been our intention in the last 20 years as we gained foreign exposure and honed our talent bench in these markets.**

For example, our project delivery innovation, both as a project delivery partner and through top-to-toe delivery, has set us apart. In managing unprecedented situations like the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented the only private-led lab testing and quarantine facilities. This enabled our construction sites to continue working throughout nationwide lockdowns. As a result, we have successfully delivered MRT Putrajaya Line on schedule, even at the peak of the pandemic.

Our strategies spanning from our scholar intake to deliberate succession planning, forms the foundation for expanding the Group's capacity and capability which will be fundamental in the delivery of our 5-year business plan. Our young next-generation leaders and successors are shaping up well and rising to their roles. In the coming years, there will be an intentional focus on further developing our talent pool and bench strength at various levels to support our rapid growth objectives.

As the Group approaches its 5-decade anniversary, we continue leveraging our proven strengths: talent development and strategic differentiation via innovation and technology.

At the core of our organisational success is a holistic talent development approach. We focus on developing our top-tier talent and prioritise on strengthening our overall talent bench as we cultivate strong business leaders and subject matter experts in technical and commercial areas. These professionals are capable of implementing target-driven business plans to ensure sustainable revenue and earnings growth with realistic win rates and margin deliveries. Internationally, we were also named as the Most Honoured Company in Asia (ex-Japan) by Institutional Investor Research, becoming the only Malaysian company to achieve this distinction in our industry. These are testaments to the good and hard work our people have put in over the last years in delivering value.

Both the Group's engineering and property arms delivered recordbreaking performances. Gamuda posted a record-breaking annual revenue of RM15 billion, a 63 percent increase from last year's revenue. Our core net profit from construction and property businesses grew 12 percent to a record-breaking RM912 million.

In reflection on the past year, I am deeply humbled that Gamuda was named the Company of the Year by The Edge Billion Ringgit Club (BRC). We also secured three other BRC 2024 awards: Highest Growth in Profit After Tax Over Three Years for Big Caps Companies (RM10 billion - RM40 billion); Highest Growth in Profit After Tax Over Three Years in the Construction Sector; and Best Corporate Responsibility Initiatives.

We anticipate inclusion in the FBM KLCI during the upcoming December semi-annual index review. After two years on the reserve list, we are optimistic about our elevation to the barometer index.

Moving forward in this statement, as you read the Group's highlights and roadmap presented by our key leaders, I would like to extend my heartfelt appreciation to our employees, Board of Directors, shareholders, business partners, and supply chain. Our continued delivery would not have been possible without your support.

Thank you.

Our autonomous tunnel boring machines (TBMs) have made substantial headway in the Western Tunnelling Package. TBMs Betty and Dorothy completed their first leg of tunnelling, arrived at Sydney Olympic Park and disassembled for soon-to-be relaunched in the opposite direction towards Westmead.

This year also marks our first full year of consolidating our transport projects business from Australia's Downer Group, which we acquired in June 2023 and have since renamed DT Infrastructure. DT Infrastructure was a strategic investment in our overall growth strategy and is already bearing fruit as we expand our market share in Australia.

We have continued our growth trajectory in Australia's infrastructure sector since we entered this market in 2019. Our maiden flagship project in the country, the Sydney Metro West – Western Tunnelling Package, to construct 9 km of twin metro rail tunnels from Sydney Olympic Park to Westmead has been progressing positively. We saw our first tunnel breakthrough in August 2024 with the successful deployment of Gamuda's pioneering autonomous tunnel boring machine technology, which was a first in Australia.

**In reviewing our recent performance, the Group's overseas construction revenue tripled to an all-time high of RM9 billion. The growth was anchored by the higher work progress of our projects in Australia, Taiwan and Singapore as our order book sits at another record high for the third consecutive year at RM32 billion and expanding.**

The M1 Pacific Motorway extension between Black Hill and Tomago in Australia is one of the largest infrastructure projects in the Hunter region's history. It is a game changer for local, regional and long-distance transport.

We also achieved the highest IS Design Rating of 'Leading' (96.8/110) for the Western Tunnelling Package under the Infrastructure Sustainability Council IS Rating Scheme, ahead of all other Sydney Metro West contracts. This demonstrates our ability to successfully translate and scale our strong local delivery track record and capabilities to our regional markets.

The Coffs Harbour Bypass project, a joint venture between Gamuda and Ferrovial; and the M1 Motorway Extension to Raymond Terrace: Black Hill to Tomago, in a joint venture with John Holland, are both well on track to be truly transformative infrastructure for the Coffs Harbour and Hunter regions once completed.

DT Infrastructure, partnering with Alstom, has secured a RM5 billion contract to upgrade and maintain Perth's rail network control systems. This METRONET High-Capacity Signalling project marks our entry into Australia's rail systems market. The project involves implementing a state-of-the-art communications-based train control system, aiming to increase network capacity by 40 percent, improve energy-efficiency, enhance cybersecurity, and prepare for future growth.

A new growth sector for the Group will be the AUD328 billion clean energy and renewables infrastructure market. Our aim is to become a leading end-to-end developer-builder-owner of assets in Australia's clean energy future and are deep in our pursuits of solar, wind, pumped hydro and transmission opportunities.

Some early wins include DT Infrastructure securing the AUD243 million contract to design and construct the Boulder Creek Wind Farm in Queensland. Awarded by Aula Energy and CS Energy, this is the first wind farm project to be delivered by Gamuda under the DT Infrastructure brand. The project includes 38 turbines generating 228 MW, powering about 85,000 homes, and 41 km of access tracks. This wind farm will support Queensland's goal of 50 percent renewable electricity supply by 2030.

We have additionally been shortlisted for multiple other solar and pumped hydro opportunities leveraging on our specialist expertise in delivering complex infrastructure, tunnelling and geotechnical engineering. As part of our localisation strategy, we have a strong team of energy specialists familiar with the Australian energy market and supplement this with expertise and partnerships from our home country of Malaysia. These include ERS Energy, Malaysia's largest solar contracting company; and Rohas Tecnic Berhad, a leading Malaysian supplier of turnkey solutions for transmission networks which will provide us with technical capability, resources, and a resilient regional supply chain.

Taiwan continues to be a promising market for the Group, as evidenced by our most recent win in October 2024. We secured our seventh infrastructure project as the main contractor for the Xizhi Donghu Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) project in Taipei. This RM4.3 billion project encompasses 5.78km of elevated viaducts and trackwork, six above-ground stations, system works and depot maintenance equipment. Separately, the joint venture is obligated to undertake, when instructed, already determined additional works valued at RM10.8 billion, comprising Xizhi Donghu Line maintenance depot and two extension lines' system and track works - the Keelung Line MRT and Minsheng Line MRT. Gamuda holds the majority share in this venture, with joint venture partners MiTac (15 percent) and Dong-Pi (10 percent).

This is Gamuda's biggest win since we entered the Taiwanese market two decades ago. The Xizhi–Donghu line is part of the 'three-ring, six-line' rapid transit system, a substantial infrastructure initiative currently underway in New Taipei City, which serves as the centre of regional development.

Reinforcing our reputation for rail excellence, in the last year, we also secured the RM3.45 billion Kaohsiung MRT Metropolitan Yellow Line YC01 Civil Engineering Package. The nine-year project, which officially commenced in February 2024, involves constructing a 4.4 km alignment, including 3.5 km of underground twin bored tunnels and four stations. Project delivery is on schedule, with design works progressing well and construction works starting to ramp up.

These two wins are on the back of the successful delivery of the Guantang Marine Bridge, built by our 70 percent-owned joint venture with Dong-Pi Construction Co. Ltd for CPC Corporation Taiwan, which has now been handed over to adjacent contractors for interfacing works. On this project, we made history as the first Malaysian company to win the prestigious Excellent Honour in Public Construction Quality Award 2024. Awarded by the Taiwan Ministry of Economic Affairs, this reflects our dedication to excellence in construction, quality, safety and timely completion.

The Guantang Marine Bridge links a Liquefied Natural Gas terminal to a man-made island and road embankment. Recognised by the Taiwan government for its safety measures, the project employed specialised risk management team with maritime meteorology expertise to schedule work based on maritime weather forecasts such as wind, wave, tide, and current, minimising potential hazards.

Adding to our accolades, our 161kV Songshu to Guangfeng Underground Transmission Line project received the Construction Golden Safety Award 2024 for Excellent Occupational Safety and Health in the Public Infrastructure category. We are expectant that Taiwan will continue to deliver a healthy pipeline of wins for us in the coming years.

Both TBM1 and TBM2 machines have arrived at Sydney Olympic Park and their retrievals have commenced for a relaunch from Rosehill service facility. Excavation works at Parramatta and Westmead are well under way and nozzle works have commenced. The excavation of the Clyde dive tunnels is substantially complete and concrete lining works have commenced. The overall progress as at end of July 2024 was on track at 65 percent.

#### **(b) Coffs Harbour Bypass Project**

Gamuda Australia, in a joint venture with Ferrovial Construction (FGJV), was awarded the Coffs Harbour Bypass Project. Transport for New South Wales has appointed the FGJV to deliver the AUD1.41 billion (RM4.15 billion) highway project, which is the largest infrastructure project in Coffs Harbour's history. Coffs Harbour is located on the NSW North Coast, approximately 550 km north of Sydney. In this 50:50 joint venture with Ferrovial Construction, Gamuda Australia will design and construct a 14 km new and upgraded four-lane highway with three tunnels blasted through rock. The project will boost the regional economy and improve connectivity, road transport efficiency and safety for local and interstate motorists.

The contract milestones are on target. The recent dry weather has allowed construction to advance significantly with drainage, earthworks, bridgeworks and tunnelling. Works have progressed well on all fronts. The overall progress as at end of July 2024 was on schedule at 46 percent.

#### **(c) M1 Motorway Extension to Raymond Terrace: Black Hill to Tomago Package**

Gamuda Australia was awarded a major road transport project worth AUD1.03 billion (RM3.03 billion) by Transport for New South Wales to deliver the Black Hill to Tomago Package of works for the M1 Motorway Extension to Raymond Terrace (near to Newcastle).

The design and construct contract will be delivered through a 60 (John Holland)/40 (Gamuda) joint venture. The design and construct contract is expected to generate RM1.21 billion revenue for the Group.

The project is one of the largest infrastructure projects in the Hunter region's history. It's a game changer for local, regional and long-distance transport, unlocking congested Hunter roads and helping complete a highway between Sydney and Brisbane. When completed in mid-2028, the M1 Motorway extension will bypass the congestion and merge points along this corridor and reduce traffic volumes across the existing network.

Permanent design is complete, which allows work to start on all fronts. Project delivery remains on schedule with bulk earthworks achieving key milestones for commencement of pavement works. Piling activities continue to progress well, followed by bridge concrete works for columns and headstocks work. Critical works for the rail corridor possession were completed as planned with the first beams installed for the viaduct. Utilities relocation works continue to progress with the new water main works ready for cut over in late August. Other utilities works including power and communication asset relocations are ongoing and support the current construction programme. The overall progress as at end of July 2024 was on schedule at 36 percent.

#### **(d) DT Infrastructure (DTI)**

On 22 February 2023, DT Infrastructure Pty Ltd ("DTI"), a wholly-owned foreign subsidiary in Australia executed an asset sale agreement with Downer EDI Works Pty Ltd and VEC Civil Engineering Pty Ltd (Downer) to acquire the Australian transport projects business of Downer Transport Projects ("DTP").

This is a design and construct contract with our design progressing well as per schedule. The site has commenced the enabling work such as hoarding erection, site access road and soil investigation work.

#### **9) Gamuda Next-Gen Digital IBS**

GIBS is strategically positioned to capitalise on the growing demand for data centres in Malaysia by leveraging its digital construction ecosystem and AI-IoT-enabled robotic manufacturing. This innovative approach ensures fast delivery while emphasising sustainability through environmentally friendly practices. By integrating advanced technologies, GIBS not only meets the increasing need for data centres but also contributes to a greener future.

#### **10) Gamuda Water**

The operation and maintenance of the Sungai Selangor Water Treatment Plant Phase 3 undertaken by Gamuda Water is going on smoothly.

#### **PROPERTY DEVELOPMENT**

**For the third consecutive year, Gamuda Land posted record-breaking sales, revenue and net profit, spearheaded by overseas projects with major contributions from QTPs.**

Gamuda Land concluded FY2024 with a record-breaking performance. Property sales surged to an all-time high of RM5 billion, surpassing last year's record of RM4.1 billion. This growth was driven by several newly launched quick-turnaround projects (QTPs), particularly in Vietnam. Notably, Phase 1 of Vietnam's Eaton Park achieved RM1 billion in sales, with all units sold out within a week of its launch.

Property revenue for the year reached RM4.2 billion, nearly doubling the RM2.8 billion recorded last year. Meanwhile, property earnings grew by 31 percent, reaching a historic high of RM411 million, up from RM315 million in the previous year. Overseas projects contributed almost half of overall property sales and revenue while overseas earnings make up two-third of Gamuda Land's earnings. Local projects' stronger earnings and margin contributions also played a significant role in the division's overall success.

Over the past year, Gamuda Land has reinforced its QTP and regionalisation strategy, aimed at delivering better results and diversifying geographical risks. The goal is to double annual property sales within five years by investing in high-yield QTP developments on top of our township projects. This strategy has yielded positive results, with strong take-up rates across several QTPs in Vietnam, Australia, and the United Kingdom. These achievements highlight the strategic focus on both domestic and international markets, leveraging high-demand projects and favourable economic conditions to drive growth. In July, Gamuda Land introduced 'Park Homes', an innovative cluster-of-8 home typology, a first-of-its-kind in Malaysia. The Park Homes product, branded as The Clove, will be introduced in three of Gamuda Land's satellite townships in the Klang Valley: Gamuda Cove, Gamuda Gardens, and The Clove Signature series at twentyfive7. This differentiated product will drive sales for the coming financial year when launched in the second quarter of 2025.

# **RM213 million property stocks were cleared in 2024; Balance unsold completed properties, mostly from local high-rise projects.**

Over the course of this financial year, RM213 million worth of completed property units were sold while RM84 million unsold completed units were added to the stockpile, leaving unsold completed properties at RM548 million as at financial year end. Overseas unsold stock is minimal while Malaysia unsold properties are mainly high-rise units. Overall, the unsold unit consist of 13 percent landed and 87 percent high-rise (2023: 18 percent landed and 82 percent high-rise).

{21}------------------------------------------------

#### **Project Updates**

#### **1) Overseas**

Total overseas sales for FY2024 amounted to RM2.5 billion, with Vietnam emerging as the largest contributor, accounting for 92 percent of total international sales. Since our entry into the Vietnamese market in 2007, our growth strategy has yielded remarkable success. This performance was significantly driven by Quick Turnaround Projects (QTP) under Gamuda Land's strategic 5-year plan.

The first half of 2024 saw significant growth and recovery in Vietnam's property market. The economy demonstrated robust performance with a GDP growth of 6.4 percent. Additionally, Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) increased by 13 percent, reaching a total of USD15 billion. This economic resilience positively influenced the real estate sector, resulting in property transactions tripling compared to the same period in 2023. There has been a notable demand for high-end apartments, reflecting continued interest from investors and increasing demand for residential properties, particularly in Ho Chi Minh City.

The positive market reception towards our projects is evident. Eaton Park's first two towers are fully sold, while the first three towers of Elysian are 90 percent sold. Artisan Park has achieved 70 percent sales and is on track for a vacant possession in Q4 FY2025. Moreover, The Meadow, a low-rise residential development comprising 212 townhouses and villas in Binh Chanh District, is 85 percent sold within just two months of launch. This development is well-positioned to meet the growing demand for premium real estate in this vibrant district. The positive market fundamentals along with our strategic focus on high impact quality projects will ensure our long-term profitability in the Vietnamese market.

Building on this momentum, we are set to launch Springville in FY2025, a strategic move to seize opportunities in Vietnam's rapidly evolving real estate market. Spanning 18.2 hectares, this integrated mixed-use township will feature both residential and commercial spaces, strategically located in the growth corridor of Nhon Trach District, Dong Nai Province. Situated just 35 km east of Ho Chi Minh City's CBD and 13 km from the upcoming USD16 billion Long Thanh International Airport, scheduled for completion in 2025, Springville is projected to achieve a GDV of USD393 million.

In the UK, the new Labour government has introduced a Draft National Planning Policy Framework that prioritises streamlined planning processes, sustainability, and infrastructure support, with a strong emphasis on economic growth and affordable housing. This policy shift is anticipated to create a robust environment for real estate and related sector investments.

In line with these favourable conditions, the West Hampstead Central development is on track for completion and sell-out by Q1 FY2025, with a current take-up rate of 91 percent. Further strengthening our foothold in the UK, Gamuda announced a RM100 million joint venture in student housing, marking our first UK student housing project in collaboration with QIP. This strategic initiative aligns with our focus on high-yield Quick Turnaround Projects (QTPs) and reinforces our growth in key markets where we already operate. In addition, construction has commenced on the Woolwich project as of June 2024, further consolidating our expansion in the UK.

The commercial office segment is also demonstrating strong momentum. In June 2024, office take-up in the City of London reached its highest level this year, with 868,814 sq ft completed across 52 transactions. This brought the total for the first half of 2024 to 2.91 million sq ft across 195 transactions, marking a 15 percent increase from the first half of 2023 and a 3 percent rise above the long-term average. Notably, 71 percent of the June take-up was BREEAM Excellent or Outstanding, reflecting a growing demand for sustainable office spaces. This trend aligns seamlessly with the full planning consent granted for the major redevelopment of 75 London Wall in the City of London.

The project will increase the building's capacity by 40 percent to 688,000 sq ft, with full refurbishment aimed at delivering energy-efficient, Grade A+ accommodation targeting BREEAM 'Outstanding', WELL Core 'Platinum', and NABERS UK 5 Star Design for Performance. The redevelopment, expected to be completed by Q3 FY2027, will also feature high-quality end-ofjourney facilities to promote active travel.

In Australia, the Reserve Bank of Australia has maintained the target cash rate at 4.35 percent for the past eight months in response to slowing inflation. This has fostered growing confidence that interest rates have peaked. However, the cash rate remains significantly elevated from its low of 0.1 percent in April 2022, which continues to influence borrowing capacities and the broader market's timing considerations for property purchases.

In light of these challenges, we have strategically focused our offerings on market segments that are less sensitive to interest rate fluctuations, such as downsizers and select local investors. This targeted approach is designed to maintain demand even in a high-interest environment. Additionally, rising construction costs have posed challenges to Australian property developments, constraining the delivery of new housing supply. To counter these impacts, we have secured our main project contracts on fixed-cost and fixed-time terms, ensuring both stability and predictability in our development timelines.

Our developments reflect this strategic resilience, The Canopy on Normanby has achieved a healthy take-up rate of 60 percent, while Fareham continues to attract strong interest, with a quarter of its units already taken up.

#### **2) Malaysia**

Ongoing projects include:

- Gamuda Cove in Southern Klang Valley
- Gamuda Gardens, Gardens Park and Kundang Estates in Sungai Buloh
- twentyfive7 in Kota Kemuning
- Horizon Hills in Iskandar Puteri

Gamuda Cove's meticulously planned township model, combined with various lifestyle facilities and amenities, has resulted in a strong market response for its residential offerings. The exclusive Wetlands Estates enclave has seen remarkable success, with The Waterlily and phase 1 of The Camellia achieving 90 percent sales. Additionally, Mori Pines has achieved 80 percent sales, Mio Springs 82 percent, and Enso Woods is fully sold.

As of July, the township has delivered over 1,450 homes, bringing Gamuda Cove's population to over 6,000 residents. In response to the growing population, the fully sold Townsquare, comprising 100 lifestyle retail shops, is on track for delivery by the end of 2024, followed by the 47 retail shops at Bay Street in 2026 offering enhanced conveniences to the community.

In the first half of 2024, Gamuda Cove signed a total of 17 new tenants from various sectors, including notable partners like Urban Marketplace, 99 Speedmart, ZUS Coffee, Dookki, Muiz Hot Chicken, and Tiga Ikan. The robust uptake in commercial offerings and new tenant absorption underscore the strong prospects of Gamuda Cove as the new catalyst for the Southern Klang Valley corridor, supported by high tourist numbers from SplashMania Waterpark and leisure activities at Discovery Park and Paya Indah Discovery Wetlands.

At Gamuda Gardens, the successful completion and handover of Illaria Hillside Homes in July marks a significant milestone, representing the fifth residential phase delivered to homebuyers. To-date, the township has delivered over 2,500 units and is now home to more than 10,000 residents. This achievement has considerably enhanced the township's appeal as a thriving residential community and has reinforced its status as a selfsustaining community.

The township's vibrancy was further boosted by the grand launch of Gamuda Luge Gardens in July. The launch introduced the fully operational FunPark components, including Skyline Luge Kuala Lumpur, which have garnered nationwide interest and significantly increased footfall to the area, attracting over 700,000 visitors per annum.

The maturation of Gamuda Gardens has positively impacted its residential and commercial developments. The semi-detached homes at Monarc have achieved an impressive take-up rate of 80 percent, while Valeria has reached a 60 percent take-up rate. On the commercial front, Gardens Square which is set for completion by December, has already achieved a notable pre-opening tenant occupancy rate of 60 percent. This development, along with the fully-tenanted, park-fronting Waterfront Village, GAIA Boulevard, and the family-themed Gamuda Luge Gardens, enriches the township's retail offerings and complements the existing amenities in Rawang.

Building on the success of Gamuda Gardens, the adjacent 532 acres mixed-use township, Gardens Park, will further strengthen Gamuda Land's presence in northern Klang Valley. This new development will replenish the landed residential offerings within the area, continuing the momentum of Gamuda Gardens. This strategic move will create synergy between both townships, which will be connected via a 1 km Park Connector, providing a seamless connection for walking, cycling, or driving. The recently unveiled Astor has already garnered strong interest, with 63 percent units reserved.

| Net (decrease)/ increase in cash and cash equivalents | (814)   | 400   |
| Cash and bank balances and investment securities      | 3,363   | 4,177 |

The Group continues to generate healthy cash flow from operating activities annually, with RM152 million net cash this year, lower than last year due to increased investment toward property development activities. The outflow of RM1.5 billion in investing activities was mainly for land acquisitions in Vietnam, pursuant to Gamuda Land's QTP strategy. Consequently, the group's gearing slightly rose to 39 percent from 25 percent last year. The Group ended FY2024 with a solid cash and bank balance of RM3.36 billion.

#### **Capital Management**

The Group's approach to capital management is to maintain a strong credit rating for its borrowings and healthy capital ratios in order to support its businesses. The Group's overseas projects are financed by borrowings denominated in the local currency of the country which the business is located in order to provide a natural hedge on the Group's foreign currency exposure.

The Group aims to maintain a self-imposed gearing limit of not more than 70 percent. At our current asset base, we have a gearing headroom to raise another RM4 billion to fund our growth plans.

#### **Group's borrowings profile**

The strategic location of twentyfive7 provides excellent accessibility to key established regions in Klang Valley, including Kota Kemuning, Shah Alam, Klang, and Subang Jaya, making it an ideal township for both business operations and residential growth. The residential components have shown strong market performance, with Luxura achieving an impressive take-up rate of 83 percent, Levane at 72 percent, and Lucent being fully sold. The recently launched Quayside Plazas service apartment is also showing a healthy uptake, with a quarter of the 465 units already taken and high interest from prospective buyers.

Commercially, the newly launched Quay District boasts a collective take-up rate of 80 percent. This includes Quayside Shoppes, which is fully sold, Quayside Square at 80 percent, and the retail segment of Quayside Plazas at 70 percent. The established Quayside Mall continues to thrive, achieving a 99 percent tenancy rate with new tenant openings such as Anytime Fitness, Chagee, and Optimum Train swimming school. Education providers, Good International School and Kiddypedia are scheduled for a 1 September opening, joining Q-Dees which is already serving the community. These strong uptake rates and the strategic town planning of both residential and commercial components underscore the robust demand and commercial viability of twentyfive7, positioning it as a prime township within the Kota Kemuning vicinity.

In the southern region, there is a marked increase in demand for residential properties, particularly in established areas such as Iskandar Malaysia and Johor Bahru. This surge has been driven by both local and foreign buyers, notably from Singapore. Additionally, the establishment of Special Economic Zones (SEZ) in Johor, coupled with improvements in transport infrastructure — such as the Rapid Transit System (RTS) — has enhanced Johor's appeal to foreign investors from Singapore and other ASEAN countries, resulting in rising property prices and a more competitive market.

This trend is particularly favourable for Horizon Hills. Its cluster home development, MontCourt, launched in July, has seen all non-Bumi units sold out. This success reflects the wider trend within Horizon Hills market, where all landed properties launched in FY2024 have demonstrated strong demand, with 90 percent of new products sold out within the first month of launch.

#### **Total assets**

The Group's total assets increased by 12 percent year-on-year mainly contributed by higher property development costs and addition of assets following the acquisition of DT Infrastructure.

#### **Total liabilities**

Total liabilities of the Group increased by 17 percent year-on-year primarily due to assumption of liabilities following the acquisition of DT Infrastructure.

#### **Owner's equity**

Owner's equity increased by 5 percent to RM11,365 million, mainly due to the earnings during the year.

#### **Quick ratio**

The Group's strong liquidity in covering two times of short-term payables is testimony of the Group's strong financial strength.

#### **Capital expenditure requirements**

There is no major capital expenditure requirement for the upcoming year, other than acquisitions of plant and machinery for new projects secured during the year.

#### **Dividend payout**

|                                   | 2024   | 2023   |
|-----------------------------------|--------|--------|
|                                   |        |        |

This year, the company declared a 16 sen ordinary dividend, 4 sen higher than the historical 12 sen, as the company lifted its second interim dividend payout to 10 sen. Additionally, the company is planning a 1:1 bonus issue to further reward shareholders, demonstrating our continued commitment to enhancing shareholder value.

#### **Core return on owner's equity**

The core return on owner's equity remained stable at 8 percent (FY2023: 8 percent), reflecting strong and resilient performance.

#### **Market Capitalisation:**

Our regional expansion strategy has delivered outstanding results, achieving all-time-high performances in our topline and bottomline. This remarkable growth has doubled Gamuda's market capitalisation within just one year.

#### **Look ahead**

The Group anticipates that next year's performance will be largely driven by overseas and domestic construction activities including construction of several data centres and higher contribution from the property division's various quick-turnaround projects (QTP).

Moving forward, the resilience of the Group is underpinned by an all-time-high construction orderbook of RM32 billion and unbilled property sales of RM7.7 billion. On top of that, the Group has a healthy balance sheet with a comfortable net gearing of 39 percent, well below our self-imposed gearing limit of 70 percent.

# **MATERIAL MATTERS**

Material matters are key sustainability issues that are significant to our business and stakeholders, as they represent our sustainability impacts on the economy, environment and people. Determining and addressing these material matters enables us to identify risks and opportunities while minimising any adverse impacts of our decisions and activities.

We conduct a comprehensive materiality assessment periodically, ensuring our sustainability priorities remain relevant and aligned with industry dynamics. Our most recent comprehensive materiality assessment was conducted in 2022. This process is complemented by an annual review and revision of material matters, keeping pace with industry benchmarks and evolving sustainability standards. Each revision undergoes formal endorsement by the Gamuda Board of Directors, affirming our commitment to informed, forward-thinking governance.

#### **Gamuda's Five-Step Materiality Assessment**

#### **Materiality Matrix**

In 2024, we reviewed our material matters by aligning them with industry peers and global sustainability reporting frameworks. Through a process of consolidation and regrouping, we streamlined our material matters from 17 to 13 key issues. As part of this refinement, Indirect Economic Impact was removed from the materiality matrix. Despite these changes, the priority of our top five Materiality Matrix remained unchanged.

# **MANAGING OUR RISKS**

In today's dynamic business landscape, effective risk management is crucial to our Group's success. We have established robust guard rails to manage project risks and ensure strategic alignment across operations. Our immediate priority is to stay on track with our annual targets for revenue, margins, and overhead costs as outlined in our 5-year business plan, safeguarding our trajectory towards long-term objectives. Central to this effort is our commitment to technical excellence in design, procurement, and project delivery, supported by a dedicated team of subject matter experts who enhance our capabilities.

We are also focused on digitising our procurement processes and construction operations, fostering transparency and speeding decision-making for delivery efficiency. By prioritising these elements, we mitigate risks and position ourselves for sustainable growth.

Detailed in Our Integrated Value Creation Model (see pages 56 to 57), we discuss potential risks in our management and governance committees to mitigate long-term impact on our business outcomes and reputation.

For a deeper dive into our risk management approach, please refer to the Risk Management Committee Report (see [page 106\)](#page-54-0).

#### **RISK DRIVERS**

- Fiscal Policy: Changes in government spending, taxation, and monetary policy can affect the overall economic climate and demand for construction and property services.
- Infrastructure Spending: Government investment in infrastructure such as transportation, energy, and water, can impact demand and delivery for construction projects.
- Political conditions: Conflicts can alter trade patterns and impose restrictions, and impact business demands in the affected regions.
- Decarbonisation roadmap: Government mandates for renewable energy and stricter energy-efficiency standards can drive demand for construction projects while potentially increasing their complexity and cost.

**Changes in government policies can pose substantial challenges and opportunities for businesses, affecting their strategies, financial performance, and regulatory requirements**

**MITIGANTS**

• Continuously adapt to changes in government policies to identify potential

risks and opportunities.

• Actively engage with regulator, business partners and supply chain to influence industry policies and ensure effective risk management and value

creation.

• Invest in and adopt innovative technologies that reduce carbon emissions, such as energy-efficient in design and construction, low carbon materials,

renewable energy systems, and less carbon intensive logistic.

#### **RISK DRIVERS**

- Labour shortages: A shortage of skilled workers in the construction industry has driven up wages and increased competition for talent.
- Rising costs: Increased material and labour costs can lead to cost overruns, affecting project budgets and profitability.
- Trade restrictions and sanctions: Tariffs, quotas, and trade restrictions can disrupt the flow of materials and equipment, increasing costs and potentially causing shortages.

Ms. Chan Wai Yen was appointed as an Independent Non-Executive Director of the Company on 1 January 2022. Subsequently, on 1 February 2023, she was appointed as a member of the Audit, Nomination and Remuneration Committees.

Ms. Chan graduated with a Bachelor of Laws Degree with First Class Honours from the University of Malaya in 1980. She was admitted as an Advocate and Solicitor to the High Court of Malaya in 1981. She began her legal practice in Maxwell, Kenion, Cowdy & Jones, a law firm in Ipoh. In 1984, Ms. Chan co-founded the legal firm W Y Chan & Roy and continued to practice law in Malaysia until 2007.

Ms. Chan's practice focus in Malaysia during the first seven years of practice was in civil and commercial litigation. In the following two decades, her practice concentrated on corporate securities and finance, as well as commercial matters.

In 2010, Ms. Chan was admitted to the Law Society of British Columbia, Canada. She practiced in the Vancouver office of Borden Ladner Gervais ("BLG"), a national law firm in Canada, and was a member of the BLG Tax Group and the Corporate & Commercial Group. She also served as a BLG Senior Consultant for Asia Pacific Market. Her advisory focus involved assisting high net worth families, particularly business families in Asia, in the area of holistic global estate planning. This encompassed inter-generational wealth transfer, asset protection, and capital preservation. Furthermore, she advised families in the establishment of strategies and processes to promote family governance, maintain family unity, and uphold family identity and integrity. Leveraging an extensive network of contacts, she collaborated with financial institutions and offshore service providers for trusts, foundations, and corporations.

Ms. Chan ceased her legal practice with BLG and applied to be a non-practicing lawyer in British Columbia in 2018. This move was intended to allow her to focus on consulting with business families and individuals, particularly in Asia, in the area of holistic global estate planning through her company, Legacy 127 Consulting Inc.

Ms. Chan has no family relationship with any Director and/or major shareholder of the Company and has no conviction for any offences within the past five years (other than traffic offences, if any). Additionally, there were no public sanctions or penalties imposed by the relevant regulatory bodies during the financial year. In October 2024, Ms. Chan informed the Audit Committee of a potential conflict of interest arising from her position as an Independent Non-Executive Director of QL Resources Berhad ("QLRB"). The relevant circumstances relate to the acquisition by a subsidiary of QLRB, namely BM GreenTech Bhd ("BMG"), of the entire shareholdings in Plus Xnergy Holdings Sdn Bhd ("PXH"). The acquisition was completed in October 2024 (after Gamuda's financial year) and resulted in PXH becoming a sub-subsidiary of QLRB. However, there is an overlap of market segments in which PXH and ERS Energy Sdn Bhd ("ERS"), a 30% associated company of Gamuda, may potentially compete in. Ms. Chan does not serve as a director of BMG nor PXH nor ERS.

During the financial year ended 31 July 2024, Ms. Chan attended all four Board meetings held.

# <span id="page-46-0"></span>**CORPORATE GOVERNANCE OVERVIEW STATEMENT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE OVERVIEW STATEMENT**

**The Board of Directors ("Board") of Gamuda Berhad ("Gamuda" or "Company") presents this statement to provide shareholders and investors with an overview of the corporate governance practices of the Company under the oversight of the Board during the financial year ended 31 July 2024 ("FY2024") and up to the date of this statement. This overview takes guidance from the key corporate governance principles as set out in the Malaysian Code on Corporate Governance ("MCCG").** 

The Corporate Governance Overview Statement is made pursuant to Paragraph 15.25(1) of the Main Market Listing Requirements **("Listing Requirements")** of Bursa Malaysia Securities Berhad **("Bursa Securities")** and guidance is drawn from Practice Note 9 of the Listing Requirements and the Corporate Governance Guide (4th Edition) issued by Bursa Securities. This overview statement which sets out a summary of the Group's corporate governance practices during FY2024 is based on the following three (3) key principles of the MCCG:

![](_page_46_Figure_4.jpeg)

This statement is to be read together with the Corporate Governance Report 2024 of the Company prepared based on a prescribed format as set out in Paragraph 15.25(2) of the Listing Requirements **("CG Report")** which is available on the Company's website at www.gamuda.com.my and Bursa Malaysia's website.

#### **COMMITMENT FROM THE BOARD**

The Board recognises the importance of maintaining adequate corporate governance practices within Gamuda and its subsidiary companies (collectively **"Group"**) and devotes considerable effort to adopt relevant best practices. Good corporate governance is crucial to sustain the Group in the long-term through the ever changing regulatory and market environment. The Board views corporate governance as an integral part of the Group's business strategy.

The Board believes that sound and effective corporate practices are fundamental to the smooth, effective and transparent operation of a company and its ability to attract investment, protect the rights of shareholders and stakeholders and enhance shareholders' value.

The Board will continuously evaluate the status of the Group's corporate governance practices and procedures with a view to adopting and implementing the best practices insofar as they are relevant to the Group, while considering the nature of the Group's businesses and the size of its business operations.

#### **SUMMARY OF CORPORATE GOVERNANCE PRACTICES**

To demonstrate Gamuda commitment to good corporate governance, the Group has benchmarked its practices to both MCCG and industry best practices.

**In FY2024, Gamuda has applied all MCCG-recommended practices.**

#### **PRINCIPLE A :**

#### **BOARD LEADERSHIP AND EFFECTIVENESS**

#### **I. Board Responsibilities**

The Board is responsible for the long-term success of the Group and the delivery of sustainable value to stakeholders. Hence, the primary role of the Board is to protect and enhance long-term stakeholder value. It sets the overall strategy for the Group, which is implemented and operated by the executive management. The Board also ensures that good corporate governance policies and practices are implemented within the Group. While discharging its duties, the Board acts in good faith, with due diligence and care and in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders.

A framework of delegated authority is in place consistent with the structure of delegation below the Board level. The Board reserves to itself certain key matters to approve, including the Group's strategic plans, major capital expenditure, corporate governance issues, dividend policy and external financial reporting.

The Board delegates responsibility for the day-to-day operation of the businesses to the Group Managing Director who is assisted by the Deputy Group Managing Director and Key Senior Management and recognises his responsibility for ensuring that the Company operates within a framework of prudent and effective controls.

In discharging his duties in leading the Group with due care, skill and diligence, the Group Managing Director is driven and guided by Our Integrated Value Creation Model as illustrated in pages 56 to 57 of this Integrated Report. This Integrated Value Creation Model has been formalised and is disseminated to employees and continuously reinforced throughout the employees' tenure with the Group.

In addition to the Integrated Value Creation Model, the Group Managing Director conducts an annual strategic review of material matters, an important process as it forms the foundation of the Group's focus areas and value creation. In determining materiality, Gamuda is guided by the following criteria:

- Topics that impact the business model (including capitals);
- Topics that impact stakeholders;
- Topics that impact EES (Economic and Governance, Environmental and Social) performance (creation of financial and non-financial values).

Guided by the criteria, Gamuda implements a close-loop, five-step materiality process, the details of which are set in pages 52 to 53 of this Integrated Report.

![](_page_46_Figure_19.jpeg)

As depicted in the illustration above, Board Committees have been established to assist the Board in its oversight function, with each Board Committee having specific areas of responsibility. However, it should be noted that the Board retains collective oversight over the Board Committees at all times. These Board Committees have been constituted with clear terms of references and they are actively engaged to ensure that the Group adheres to good corporate governance.

{47}------------------------------------------------

The Board remains committed to assessing its overall responsibility for risk oversight, consistently gauging whether it should embrace the recommended step-up approach outlined in the MCCG. This entails a continuous evaluation of whether risk oversight is best conducted by the full Board itself or entrusted to standing committees, comprising majority of independent directors.

The Board agreed not to adopt Practice 10.3 - Step Up for the following reasons:

- i. Gamuda has an effective risk management and internal control framework.
- ii. The Audit Committee Chairperson is a member of the Risk Management Committee.
- iii. The Board is informed of threats, opportunities, and necessary control measures to make informed decisions.
- iv. Minutes of the Risk Management Committee are presented as a separate agenda item to the Board for discussion and deliberation.

The Board receives the minutes of all Board Committee meetings at the Board meeting following the Board Committee's meeting. The Chair of the respective Committees will also verbally report on significant areas of discussion and key decisions. To assist each Committee in discharging its responsibilities, each committee has an annual meeting planner that sets out the scheduled items of business and reports to be considered during the year.

The Board articulates its roles and responsibilities in its Directors' Handbook, outlining the areas reserved for the Board's decision-making. Originally adopted in 2002, the Directors' Handbook has now been replaced by a contemporary Board Charter. This new Charter, recommended by the Nomination Committee and approved by the Board on 26 September 2024, aligns our governance practices with current standards and best practices. This Board Charter is accessible on Gamuda's corporate website at www.gamuda.com.my.

There is a clear division of responsibilities at the helm of the Company to ensure a balance of authority and power. The roles of the Chairman and the Group Managing Director are distinct and separate.

The Chairman of the Company is an Independent Non-Executive Director who through the Board, provides overall oversight of the Management and reflects the Company's commitment to uphold corporate governance. The Chairman leads the Board by setting the tone at the top, and managing the Board effectiveness by focusing on strategy, governance and compliance. Where necessary, the Chairman will conduct separate sessions with the Non-Executive Directors **("NEDs")** to allow for discussion on any pertinent issues raised by the NEDs and/or issues from the Management.

For the financial year under review, rather than holding a separate session, the Chairman and NEDs conducted site visits to project sites. In January 2024, the Board visited projects in Vietnam and,

#### **PRINCIPLE A :**

#### **BOARD LEADERSHIP AND EFFECTIVENESS**

### **CORPORATE GOVERNANCE OVERVIEW STATEMENT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE OVERVIEW STATEMENT**

local sites including the twentyfive7 site and Quayside Mall in August 2024. These visits provided an in-depth perspective on the Group's project progress, ESG initiatives, and governance framework, enhancing the Board's understanding and oversight.

The Board is supported by suitably qualified and competent Company Secretaries who are members of the relevant professional bodies. They are accountable directly to the Board on all Board and governance matters. The Company Secretaries also have an internal reporting line to the Group Managing Director on corporate secretarial and legal matters in respect of the business. The appointment of Company Secretaries is based on the capability and proficiency determined by the Board. The Constitution of the Company permits the removal of Company Secretaries by the Board.

All members of the Board, whether as a whole or in their individual capacity have access to the advice and services of the Company Secretaries on all matters relating to the Group to assist them in furtherance of their duties. The Board is regularly updated and kept informed by the Company Secretaries and the Management of the regulatory and governance requirements such as restrictions in dealing with the securities of the Company and updates as issued by the various regulatory authorities including the latest developments in the legislations and regulatory framework affecting the Group.

The Board has adopted a Directors' Code of Conduct on 28 September 2016. In addition to the Company Directors' Code of Ethics established by the Companies Commission of Malaysia, the Directors' Code of Conduct is the Board's commitment towards establishing a corporate culture which prescribes ethical conduct that permeates throughout the Company and ensuring the implementation of appropriate internal systems to support, promote and ensure its compliance. The Directors' Code of Conduct is available for reference on Gamuda's corporate website at www.gamuda.com.my.

The Board recognises the importance of prompt and timely dissemination of accurate and sufficient information concerning the Company and its Group to shareholders, investors and other stakeholders to enable them to make an informed decision. A Corporate Disclosure Policy for the Group was adopted on 28 September 2016 to set out the policies and procedures on disclosure of material information of the Group following emphasis by Bursa Securities as outlined in Bursa Securities' Corporate Disclosure Guide.

Accordingly, the Group Managing Director together with the Group Chief Financial Officer evaluates the release of all major communications to investors or Bursa Securities. The Corporate Disclosure Policy is also available for reference on Gamuda's corporate website at www.gamuda.com.my.

The Board views procurement as a critical area that needs to undergo transformation into a more strategic discipline and value-adding function for Gamuda's business. To survive the current industry volatility and respond to the pressure to deliver projects in a more transparent and cost-effective manner, steps have been taken to re-invent procurement and ensure that the Group remains resilient. Procurement and supply chains are of the highest importance from the very beginning of every project that Gamuda undertakes as a Group. The Group-wide Digital Procurement Platform was rolled out in financial year 2018 to make procurement more transparent and effective by using a consistent, collaborative approach that leverages on the SAP Ariba platform, embracing supply chain and procurement best practices to improve value and sustainable savings. The Digital Procurement Platform is available for reference on Gamuda's corporate website at www.gamuda.com.my.

As a Group, Gamuda commits to conducting its business in a sustainable manner by addressing climate change and establishing limits to our carbon emissions. The Gamuda Green Plan 2025 (as illustrated on [page 118 o](#page-60-0)f this Integrated Report) was launched in conjunction with World Environment Day on 5 June 2021. It is a comprehensive framework and roadmap that charts tangible targets driven on ESG dimensions set forth over the next five years, with an extended view to 2030 and beyond. It commits the entire Group to circular construction with specific steps to reduce direct and indirect corporate greenhouse gases emission intensity by 30 percent in 2025, and by 45 percent in 2030. Taking decisive action on climate change, our Sustainability Steering Committee is chaired by top-level leadership to aggressively drive our Green Plan forward. Gamuda governs its sustainability matters (Economic, Environment and Social) through a comprehensive governance structure firmly held by risk and business representation, as illustrated below:

#### **GAMUDA SUSTAINABILITY GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE**

**Group Chief ESG Officer**

A full ESG Impact Report is set out in pages 112 to 237 of this Integrated Report.

A cornerstone of Gamuda's Green Plan is advancing sustainability through digitalisation. With a proven track record in delivering technology-driven solutions for major public infrastructure and property projects, Gamuda has been actively modernising its technology stack to scale across the world, drive collaboration across borders and inculcate the "Gamuda Way" of running projects. Under the leadership of Gamuda's Group Chief Digital Officer, Gamuda has streamlined two technology teams, Gamuda Excellence Transformation **("GET")** and Gamuda Information Technology **("GIT")** to deliver a seamless digital experience for our users.

In June 2021, Gamuda launched the **GET** initiative – an innovation department with a mandate to drive digital innovation across the Group. Through GET, the Gamuda Innovation Hub **("GAIN Hub")**  was established to house the centre of excellence and subject matter experts that provide support and leadership for all projects worldwide in areas such as AI, Data, Augmented Reality, BIM, Digital Engineering, Software engineering and GIS. The GAIN Hub has hosted many notable leaders in the technology industry including Jim Lynch, the Senior Vice President of Autodesk Construction and Mark Micallef, the Google Cloud Managing Director – SEA validating the world-class work happening at the innovation hub.

As the Company expands its international operations, leveraging technology becomes increasingly vital for facilitating cross-border collaboration, enhancing project visibility, and reinforcing our innovative brand image. The GET Team has created and deployed the Gamuda Digital Operating System **("GDOS")** which is an integrated standard set of tools for projects that includes Autodesk Construction Cloud, Oracle P6 and SAP S4/Hana underpinned by the data warehouse, Google Cloud BigQuery to drive data collection across the globe. Gamuda has also developed BotUnify, Gamuda's GenAI marketplace of information that enables users to build their own bots on their own documents.

This innovation has catapulted Gamuda to the global stage with Justin Chin presenting the keynote for Autodesk University in 2023, the biggest global construction technology conference. John Lim has received the Autodesk Construction Champion 2023 award and has been recognised in the Autodesk 40 under 40 for 2023.

In 2023, the GIT Team started modernising Gamuda's core infrastructure with a move to Cloud. For example, Gamuda has successfully migrated our SAP S4/Hana to Google Cloud, a first for the region. Leveraging on our long-standing partnership with Google Cloud, Gamuda has also launched the Gamuda AI Academy, a community initiative by Yayasan Gamuda to train the next generation of AI experts on Google Cloud for Malaysia.

Recognising the critical importance of Information Technology **("IT")** governance, information security, and cybersecurity, the Group achieved ISO/IEC 27001:2022 certification on 17 November 2023. This certification confirms that our Information Security Management System **("ISMS")** meets international best practices and incorporates the latest advancements in mitigating cybersecurity threats.

Recognising that social media usage may affect Gamuda's business, interests and reputation, as well as trigger violations of certain laws, rules and regulations, the Group has adopted a Social and Digital Media Policy on 1 April 2018, which was revised on 13 September 2023. With the Social and Digital Media Policy in place, all employees are expected to act responsibly and ensure that their productivity is not affected.

The Social and Digital Media Policy is available for reference on Gamuda's corporate website at www.gamuda.com.my.

#### **II. Board Composition**

Following the Board composition revamp completed in the last financial year, the Board maintains its structure of five NEDs, four of whom are Independent Directors, alongside one Group Managing Director and one Deputy Group Managing Director. This ongoing composition upholds the Listing Requirements, ensuring that independent non-executive directors continue to constitute at least one-third of the Board and that a qualified director under Paragraph 15.09 (1) (c) of the Listing Requirements remains on the Audit Committee.

Furthermore, the Board's majority of Independent Directors is in line with Practice 5.2 of the MCCG. As Gamuda is classified as a Large Company, maintaining a predominantly independent Board is in accordance with this recommended practice.

In compliance with the Listing Requirements, the Board, on the recommendation of the Nomination Committee, adopted a Directors' Fit and Proper Policy on 29 June 2022. This policy is accessible on Gamuda's corporate website at www.gamuda.com.my. The primary objective of the said policy is:

- to define the approach for appointing and re-electing Directors within the Group; and
- to provide guidance to the Nomination Committee and the Board in evaluating and assessing candidates for Board appointments and those seeking re-election at Gamuda's annual general meetings.

The Directors' biographical details are outlined on pages 70 to 77 of this Integrated Report. A complete list of Directors, including their roles, functions, and biographies, is also available at Gamuda's corporate website at www.gamuda.com.my.

**Age Diversity (as at 31 July 2024)** The Board is satisfied that the current composition with majority Independent Directors fairly represents the investment of the majority and minority shareholders in the Company. The current members of the Board bring with them a broad range of business, financial, technical and public service background.

The Board is a firm believer in promoting diversity in its membership, including gender, ethnicity and age, and strives to maintain the right balance for the effective functioning of the Board.

Embracing diversity, the Board established a Diversity and Inclusion Policy on 28 September 2016 and has consistently maintained a minimum of 30 percent representation of women directors, valuing their fresh perspectives and contributions. Currently, women make up 57 percent of the Board, exceeding the 30 percent requirement under the MCCG. This reflects the Board's unwavering commitment to diversity and its crucial role in the Group's success.

- Board's structure, operations, roles and responsibilities and others;
- Board Committees composition, expertise, support and communications.

Following the internal evaluation, the Nomination Committee concluded that the Board as a whole and its Board Committees have been effective in their overall discharge of functions and duties.

#### **PRINCIPLE A :**

#### **BOARD LEADERSHIP AND EFFECTIVENESS**

## **CORPORATE GOVERNANCE OVERVIEW STATEMENT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE OVERVIEW STATEMENT**

The Board regularly reviews the independence of each Independent Director by undertaking annual assessment of the independence of its Independent Directors. The criteria for assessing the independence of an Independent Director were developed by the Nomination Committee with the support of the Company Secretaries which include the relationship between the Independent Director and the Company and his/her involvement in any significant transaction with the Company. In addition, all Directors are required to disclose to the Board any conflicts of interest or duty and material personal interest in any matter that relates to the affairs of the Company.

On 27 September 2023, the Board approved revisions to the Nomination Committee's Terms of Reference, based on the Committee's recommendation. This review aimed to align with the MCCG and bolster the Group's commitment to robust governance practices.

#### **III. Remuneration**

The Board has in place a Remuneration Policy for Directors and Key Senior Management which is clear and transparent, designed to support and drive business strategy and long-term objectives of the Gamuda Group.

In this regard, the Remuneration Committee is responsible to review the said policy from time to time to ensure the same remain competitive, appropriate, and in alignment with the prevalent market practices. The said policy was approved by the Board for adoption on 27 June 2018 and is available for reference on Gamuda's corporate website at www.gamuda.com.my.

On 26 September 2024, the Board approved revisions to the Remuneration Committee's Terms of Reference, following the Remuneration Committee's recommendation. These revisions are designed to align with the MCCG and ensure compliance with regulatory requirements as well as promoting transparency and accountability within the Group.

The Remuneration Committee's main responsibility is to review and recommend to the Board the framework for the remuneration of Executive Directors and Key Senior Management particularly the remuneration packages for the Executive Directors of the Company in all its forms, as well as the fees payable to the NEDs, drawing from outside advice where necessary. The Remuneration Committee aims to ensure that Directors' remuneration is competitive, motivates good performance and loyalty, and supports growth in shareholder value.

During FY2024, the Remuneration Committee undertook the following reviews of the remuneration packages prepared by the Human Resource Department:-

- a. The Group Managing Director's and Deputy Group Managing Director's remunerations;
- b. The NEDs' (include Independent Directors) remuneration; and
- c. Key Senior Management's remunerations.

The objective of the above reviews was to align the Executive Directors' remuneration packages and NEDs' fees with the remuneration of Executive Directors and NEDs from peer companies in the same industries.

The review confirmed that the remuneration for the Group Managing Director and the Deputy Group Managing Director is in line with benchmarks for similar publicly listed companies. In light of the Group's strong financial performance in FY2022 and FY2023, and following the Remuneration Committee's recommendation, the Board approved the following adjustments on 12 January 2024, effective from 1 January 2024:

- a. Reinstatement of the Group Managing Director's and Deputy Group Managing Director's salaries to their pre-2020 levels, without any additional increase;
- b. Bonus was granted and paid to both the Group Managing Director and Deputy Group Managing Director; and
- c. Annual salary increments and bonuses were also approved for Key Senior Management.

The Board (save for the NEDs) has decided to maintain the remuneration package, encompassing Directors' fees and allowances, for the NEDs (including the Independent Directors) for FY2024 at the same level and structure as in FY2023.

Detailed information on the Directors' remuneration for FY2024 on a named basis is disclosed under Note 6 of the Financial Statements section in this Integrated Report and Practice 8.1 of the CG Report while the detailed information of the Company's top five Key Senior Management on a named basis are disclosed under Practice 8.2 of the CG Report.

#### **PRINCIPLE B :**

#### **EFFECTIVE AUDIT AND RISK MANAGEMENT**

**I. Audit Committee**

The Audit Committee takes on the role of assisting the Board in the discharge of its fiduciary duties, the responsibility of overseeing the financial reporting process and ensuring that the results of the Company's operations are fairly presented in its financial statements.

In discharging its oversight roles on governance and internal controls, the Audit Committee is assisted by the Head of Internal Audit and the Chief Integrity Officer who leads the Group's in-house internal audit (assurance) and integrity and governance functions, respectively.

The composition of the Audit Committee is in line with Practice 9.1 of the MCCG which requires that the Audit Committee Chairman and the Board Chairman to be held by different Independent Director of the Company.

A full Audit Committee Report is set out on [page 107](#page-54-0) of this Integrated Report.

The effectiveness, performance and independence of the external auditors i.e. Ernst & Young PLT **("EY")** is reviewed annually by the Audit Committee. If it becomes necessary to replace the external auditors for performance or independence reasons, the responsibility for the selection, appointment and removal of the external auditors has been delegated to the Audit Committee by the Board pursuant to the External Auditor Policy which was approved by the Board on 28 September 2017. The said policy was revised twice by the Audit Committee on 23 September 2020 and 16 June 2022. The revision made on 16 June 2022 was to streamline the said policy with the MCCG. The External Auditor Policy is available for reference on Gamuda's corporate website at www.gamuda.com.my.

EY has provided the required confirmation of their independence to the Audit Committee that they are and have been independent throughout the conduct of the audit engagement during FY2024 in accordance with:

- the By-Laws (on Professional Ethics, Conduct and Practice) of the Malaysian Institute of Accountants; and
- the International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including International Independence Standards).

The Audit Committee has on 23 September 2024, reviewed the suitability and independence of EY and is satisfied that EY has met the relevant criteria prescribed under Paragraph 15.21 of the Listing Requirements. Thus, the Audit Committee has recommended that the Board endorses EY's re-appointment for the ensuing financial year and recommends that the shareholders of the Company approve EY's re-appointment at the 48th AGM.

EY has attended two out of the four Audit Committee Meetings of the Company to discuss their audit plan, audit findings and the financial statements as well as the provision of additional pre-concurred services pursuant to EY's general policy. Through the Audit Committee, EY would highlight to the Board matters which require the Audit Committee's or the Board's attention together with the recommended corrective actions. The Management of the Company is responsible for ensuring that all corrective actions are undertaken within an appropriate time frame.

The Audit Committee also meets EY without the presence of the Executive Directors and Management as this allows for free and honest exchange of views and opinions on matters related to external auditors' audit and their findings. For this purpose, the Audit Committee and EY met twice (September 2023 and June 2024) during the financial year under review.

The Audit Committee has considered the provision of the non-audit services by EY during the financial year under review and concluded that the provision of these services did not compromise their independence and objectivity. The total amount of audit fees paid/payable to the external auditors for FY2024 is RM5,690,000/- (2023: RM3,587,000/-). The non-audit fees incurred for services rendered to the Group by the external auditors and its affiliates for FY2024 was RM476,000/-. (2023: RM11,015,000/-). The non-audit fees are mainly in relation to taxation services and advisory fees.

Significant related party transactions of the Group for the financial year are disclosed in Note 41 of the Financial Statements section in this Integrated Report. Except for those disclosed in the Financial Statements, there were no material contracts of the Group involving Directors' and major shareholders' interest during the period.

The Audit Committee has reviewed the related party transactions that arose within the Group to ensure that the transactions were fair and reasonable, not detrimental to the minority shareholders and were in the best interests of the Company.

#### **EFFECTIVE AUDIT AND RISK MANAGEMENT INTEGRITY IN CORPORATE REPORTING AND MEANINGFUL RELATIONSHIP WITH STAKEHOLDERS**

#### **II. Risk Management and Internal Control Framework**

The Board is satisfied that risk management policies and procedures designed and implemented by the Management of the Company through the Risk Management Committee is prudent in ensuring that an effective internal control and risk management systems are in place to enable risk to be assessed and managed.

The Risk Management Committee's focus is on the Group's key operational risks that could have an impact on the Group's viability and sustainability. The work of this Committee forms an important part of the Group's control function. Significant risks faced by the business are identified and evaluated based on the likelihood and potential impact of each risk and where necessary, actions to mitigate the risks were also identified. The Risk Management Committee Report is set out on [page 106 o](#page-54-0)f this Integrated Report.

The Board also takes into consideration advice from the Audit Committee and the Risk Management Committee, reports received from the external auditors and any other related matters which have come to its attention.

The Statement on Risk Management and Internal Control of the Group which provides an overview of the state of internal control within the Group, is set out on pages 104 to 105 of this Integrated Report.

#### **III. Integrity and Governance Unit**

In line with the Strategic Plan of Integrity and Governance Unit 2019 - 2021 designed by the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission **("MACC")**, the establishment of an Integrity and Governance Unit **("IGU")** was approved by the Board on 13 December 2019 to showcase its strong commitment towards upholding integrity.

The Statement by IGU enumerating its activities during the financial year under review are set out o[n page 111 o](#page-56-0)f this Integrated Report.

To further strengthen the Group's integrity and governance framework, the following two policies have been adopted by the Group, namely:-

- The Anti-Bribery & Corruption Policy; and
- The Whistleblowing Policy and Procedures (supersedes the whistleblowing policy adopted by the Group in 2011).

The aforesaid policies are available for reference on Gamuda's corporate website at www.gamuda.com.my.

Following the adoption of the above two policies, the IGU has implemented Integrity Pledges for Directors and the Company employees beginning in the financial year 2021. The pledge sets a clear leadership tone that there is no compromise on the issue of corruption and reinforces the will and corruption-free stand of the Board and the Management of Gamuda as well as the Group. It also demonstrates Gamuda's long standing commitment to promote integrity and good governance amongst its personnel and further reaffirms the Group's stand in ensuring that there are no corrupt practices or elements of corruption throughout the Group and that any abuse of power will not be tolerated.

During the financial year, IGU undertook several activities and initiatives to strengthen integrity and reinforce governance, including:

- Conducting trainings, workshops, and engagements with Business Units, as well as utilising e-communication through Gamuda Workplace.
- Annual renewal of the Employee Integrity Pledge via the Gamuda Employee Management System (GEMS).
- Reinforcing ethical behaviour throughout the organisation.
- Providing guidelines for declaring and managing conflicts of interest.
- Performing Corruption Risk Assessment to identify potential vulnerabilities and improve mitigation strategies.
- Conducting a whistleblowing perception survey to assess and enhance reporting mechanisms.
- Engaging with MACC to ensure alignment with national anticorruption standards and best practices.

These initiatives were aimed at identifying areas for improvement and enhancing the organisation's integrity and governance practices.

#### **I. Communication with Shareholders and Investors**

The Company strives to maintain an open transparent channel of communication with its shareholders, institutional investors, analysts and the public at large with the objective of providing as clear and complete picture of the Group's performance and financial position as possible. Communication with shareholders and investors is of considerable importance to the Company.

As part of its corporate governance initiatives, the Company has set up a full-time Investor Relations **("IR")** unit which primary role is to implement effective IR policies and programmes. A comprehensive IR report enumerating its policy, practices and programmes, during the financial year under review is as set out on pages 101 to 103 of this Integrated Report.

On 19 June 2024, Institutional Investor Research **("II Research")** ranked Gamuda as one of the top three companies in the industrial and infrastructure sector across Asia, making Gamuda the only Malaysian company to achieve this distinction. Additionally, Gamuda was among the 45 companies to be distinguished as the "Most Honoured Company" in Asia (ex-Japan), securing second place for "Best CEO" (Dato' Lin Yun Ling) and "Best ESG", first place for "Best Investor Relations Professional" (Clarence Boudville), and third place for "Overall Best Investor Relations." The ranking by II Research was based on votes from 2,493 portfolio managers and buy-side analysts, and 492 sell-side analysts. These accolades solidifies its regional strategic growth across the Asia-Pacific market, underscored by the prestige of II Research, a global independent performance and qualitative market intelligence. It further highlights Gamuda's strong financial performance, exceptional management, and proactive approach to investor relations, which have contributed to its ongoing success in projects across Australia, Taiwan, Vietnam, Singapore, the United Kingdom, and Malaysia.

#### **II Conduct of General Meetings**

Gamuda's Annual General Meeting **("AGM")** is a time-honoured tradition and a key platform for direct communication between the Board, shareholders, and stakeholders. At the AGM, material information such as financial reports and audits are discussed, providing shareholders with credible insights to make informed decisions.

To facilitate effective participation and engagement with shareholders, all Board members, with the exception of the Deputy Group Managing Director who was representing Gamuda at a groundbreaking ceremony in Tenom, Sabah attended by the Prime Minister of Malaysia and the Chief Minister of Sabah, were present at Gamuda's Forty-Seventh **("47th")** AGM held on 7 December 2023. The 47th AGM was successfully conducted virtually via video conferencing.

The Chairman of the Board presided over the 47th AGM with a focus to orderliness and transparency, ensuring that shareholders and proxies had ample opportunity to ask questions. A detailed presentation addressed inquiries from the Minority Shareholder Watch Group and provided a thorough review of the Group's operations and business outlook. Additionally, the Group Chief Financial Officer, the Heads of Business Units (including Gamuda Engineering and Gamuda Land), and the Company's external auditors, EY, were present to respond to any questions from shareholders and proxies.

In line with good corporate governance practice, more than 21 days' notice has always been given for AGMs every year. For this year's 48th AGM scheduled for 5 December 2024, the Notice will be issued on 7 November 2024. The notification of the publication of this Integrated Report and the Notice of the 48th AGM is available on the Company's website and Bursa Malaysia's website, respectively.

Commencing from the Fortieth **("40th")** AGM of the Company in 2016, poll voting using electronic voting system was conducted. Virtual AGM is a great way to conduct voting because it is more efficient and removes potential bias by shareholders and/or proxies. It is better than "show of hand." The results provide a more accurate and quantifiable reflection of how the Company is perceived by its shareholder base.

Continuing the Company's commitment to sustainable practices and to promote eco-friendliness, the forthcoming 48th AGM of the Company will continue to be conducted virtually i.e. through live streaming and using Remote Participation and Voting Facilities to give shareholders and/or proxies opportunity to follow and participate in the AGM effectively.

This Corporate Governance Overview Statement was approved by the Board of Gamuda on 26 September 2024.

#### **INVESTOR RELATIONS**

#### **POLICY, PRACTICES AND PROGRAMMES**

The Board recognises Investor Relations (IR) as a key component of its Corporate Governance obligations. To meet the high expectations of the investment community, the Board has set up a dedicated IR unit headed by the Group Managing Director and assisted by the Senior Group General Manager, Investor Relations, to provide direct access to top management in all matters pertaining to Investor Relations.

The Board's primary objective is to provide all necessary information to the financial community such that shareholders, investors and potential investors can make an informed judgement on the fair value of the company's shares consistently over time. By doing so, this will help to create demand for the company's shares and eventually optimise the company's cost of capital. To enhance the effectiveness of the IR unit, the Board has instituted a comprehensive IR policy and with the following objectives, guidelines and mandates:

{52}------------------------------------------------

# **CORPORATE GOVERNANCE OVERVIEW STATEMENT**

#### **1) Equal Access to Information**

As a publicly listed group, the Board is acutely aware of the need to always provide fair and equal access to information for all classes of investors. Investors play an important role in the successful growth and development of the Group. The Board, therefore, treats all classes of investors equally, notwithstanding the wide range of investors, many of whom have differing investment objectives and mandates. The IR unit caters to the demands of all types of investors, including retail and institutional investors, short and longterm investors, and domestic and foreign investors.

In line with IR best practices, all investors are provided with the relevant corporate information as and when requested. Price sensitive information is always disclosed to Bursa Malaysia before being disclosed to any individual investor. As far as is practicable, all requests for investor meetings are completely fulfilled. In addition, the IR unit actively reaches out to overseas investors on a regular basis to meet with those who are not able to travel to Malaysia.

Private and small group investor meetings and regional investor conferences have increasingly adopted a hybrid approach post-pandemic. While in-person meetings have made a strong comeback, virtual engagements remain essential for connecting with international investors. This strategy ensures that investors who prefer virtual engagement remain fully connected while also providing opportunities for face-to-face interactions where feasible. This hybrid strategy ensures we continue to meet the communication needs of our diverse global investor community.

#### **2) Building Trust and Credibility**

A highly regarded and credible management team is one of the prerequisites for any investor. The Board recognises that trust and credibility can only be built up over time and requires a long-term commitment to protecting investors' interests. As such, the Board takes all necessary steps to ensure that critical investor issues are addressed promptly, effectively and accurately so that investors are always kept abreast of corporate developments and have a broad and clear understanding of strategic issues.

In recognition of our commitment to excellence, Institutional Investor Research (II Research) has ranked Gamuda among the top three best Asian companies in the Industrials (including Infrastructure) sector in the 2024 Asia Pacific (ex-Japan) Executive Team. Additionally, Gamuda was named one of the Most Honoured Companies for the Rest of Asia, a distinction achieved by only two Malaysian companies. These accolades were further complemented by top rankings in four specific categories: No. 2 for Chief Executive Officer, No. 2 for Environmental, Social and Governance, No. 1 for Investor Relations Professional, and No. 3 for Overall Investor Relations. Rounding out these honours, Gamuda was named 'Company of the Year 2024' in the Billion Ringgit Club by The Edge, a testament to the Group's leadership in the Malaysian industry.

#### **3) Fostering High-Quality Relationships**

High-Quality relationships can only be nurtured by continuously engaging with the investment community, both through good times, as well as during difficult periods. In this respect, the IR unit conducts regularly scheduled dialogue sessions with investors to provide corporate updates, explain the Group's strategic direction, outline business prospects, and clarify financial issues. Should circumstances require, unscheduled dialogue sessions are occasionally arranged to explain and clarify any major corporate developments. Through these dialogue sessions, valuable feedback on various issues is also often obtained from the investment community.

#### **4) Maintaining Open and Honest Communication Channels**

Given the cyclical nature of the Group's key business sectors, business prospects are not always necessarily positive. Given this reality, the Board believes in portraying an honest assessment of the Group's business prospects, even if prospects may not be particularly bright. In doing so, it is hoped that investors will obtain a realistic understanding of the business cycles and will be in a better position to make informed investment decisions.

#### **PROGRAMMES AND ACTIVITIES**

A dedicated Investor Relations (IR) unit has been set up by the Board to implement effective IR programmes and activities in line with its IR policies. This unit is ultimately headed by the Group Managing Director, whilst the day-to-day activities are handled by the unit's Senior Group General Manager. To further enhance our engagement and service levels with the investment community, the IR team has recently been expanded to include another experienced professional. Additional support is provided by various division heads when necessary.

Gamuda is a proud founding member of the Malaysian Investor Relations Association (MIRA) and played a significant role in promoting IR excellence. Following MIRA's transition to Bursa Malaysia in July 2023, Gamuda remains committed to supporting Bursa Malaysia's leadership in advancing investor relations standards within the industry.

#### **Investor Relations Activities**

FY2024 represented a complete return to normalcy in business operations and investor engagement. The IR unit continued to utilise the hybrid model, balancing virtual and in-person interactions that became effective during the pandemic.

Regular quarterly briefings were conducted virtually, aligning with participant preferences. However, the 3QFY2024 results briefing was held as a hybrid event to present the Group's new 4-year business plan, accommodating both in-person and remote attendees. Beyond these briefings, the IR unit resumed in-person engagements for various activities, including marketing roadshows, investor conferences, oneon-one and group meetings, and project site visits. These physical engagements facilitated more in-depth discussions and strengthened relationships within the investment community.

# **CORPORATE GOVERNANCE OVERVIEW STATEMENT**

#### **PRINCIPLE C :**

#### **INTEGRITY IN CORPORATE REPORTING AND MEANINGFUL RELATIONSHIP WITH STAKEHOLDERS**

Throughout FY2024, there was an increase in participation in both overseas and domestic conferences, with more invitations to attend physical events. Engagement levels at these conferences were robust, reflecting sustained interest in the company's developments. Additionally, there was a notable rise in inquiries and meetings with foreign investors.

#### **Key Investor Relations Issues**

FY2024 brought a heightened focus on the Group's regionalisation strategy. The year's performance was largely driven by overseas construction activities, with major progress on projects in Australia, Taiwan, and Singapore. The acquisition of DT Infrastructure, completed on 22 February 2023, fully contributed to this year's results. Additionally, our property division benefitted from higher contributions from newly launched Quick Turnaround Projects (QTP), further boosting overall performance. The strong stock price appreciation in FY2024 reflects the successful execution of these growth strategies. As a result, the Group's market capitalisation has exceeded RM20 billion, ranking us among the top 25 largest stocks on Bursa Malaysia.

The IR team engaged extensively with investors, providing regular updates on our strategic direction and the prospects of our construction division, both domestically and internationally. Notable milestones included the Kaohsiung MRT Yellow Line – Package YC01 in Taiwan, where we secured a leading role with an 88 percent share; the West Coast Station and Tunnels - MRT Cross Island Line (Phase 2) in Singapore, our first independent venture without joint partners; and the largest by route length High-Capacity Signalling Project in Australia, won by DT Infrastructure in partnership with Alstom Transport Australia Pty Limited.

In Malaysia, the data centre sector's growth caught the attention of investors, particularly as our technological advancements, such as the Next-Gen Digital Industrialised Building System (IBS), played a pivotal role in securing two significant data centre projects, including a hyperscale data centre. Investor interest in our innovation hubs and Next-Gen Digital IBS has been strong. This year, we hosted three visits to our innovation hub and four to our IBS facilities, where we provided insights into the technologies driving our construction processes and their potential for future projects.

On the property front, investor interest remained strong, particularly in our key township projects: Gamuda Gardens, Gamuda Cove and twentyfive7. In Vietnam, the successful launch of Eaton Park, where two towers were fully sold out within two days, generated significant attention, alongside new QTPs like The Meadow and Springville. In the United Kingdom, the redevelopment of 75 London Wall, which received full consent to proceed, and the initiation of our first purpose-built student accommodation (PBSA) project in partnership with Singapore-based Q Investment Partners, were key areas of discussion with investors.

To further showcase our projects and strengthen investor relations, particularly in Australia as a key market for construction and Vietnam as a key market for property, the IR team organised two overseas trips for investors and analysts in FY2024. The November 2023 trip to Sydney focused on our construction projects, while the May 2024 visit to Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC) highlighted our property developments, including the highly successful Eaton Park.

Our ambitious target to double the Group's top-line to RM30 billion by FY2028 has been well-received by investors. This plan includes doubling revenue in both the construction and property segments, with a focus on domestic projects for near-term growth and overseas projects for long-term sustainability. Scaling up our QTP property portfolio also remains a key area of interest for investors.

Our Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) initiatives continue to be closely monitored by investors in line with global trends. Quarterly ESG updates, included in our financial statements, have enhanced transparency. The active involvement of our Group Chief ESG Officer in investor meetings has ensured that our ESG strategies and progress, particularly under the Gamuda Green Plan 2025, are communicated effectively, keeping investors fully informed of our targets and achievements.

#### **Electronic Communication**

Broader investor communication also takes place via our corporate website at www.gamuda.com.my as well as through the Integrated Report, Annual General Meeting (AGM) and Extraordinary General Meeting (EGM).

There is a wealth of information online. All announcements made to Bursa Malaysia are updated on our corporate website as soon as practicable. In addition, slides and notes from the quarterly investor briefings are also uploaded to our website for the benefit of shareholders unable to attend these briefings.

#### **Annual General Meeting**

In line with the new practices, the Group's AGM will once again be held virtually this year. The Board seeks to encourage shareholder attendance at its virtual AGM. The Chairmen of the Audit, Remuneration and Nomination Committees, together with other Directors, will usually attend the AGM. Shareholders are encouraged to raise any pertinent issues at the meeting.

# **STATEMENT ON RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROL**

#### **BOARD'S RESPONSIBILITY**

The Board of Gamuda Berhad (the Group and the Company) affirms the overall responsibility for maintaining a sound system of risk management and internal control so as to safeguard shareholders' interests and the Group's assets. The system of risk management and internal control is designed to manage, but may not totally eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives. Accordingly, such systems can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material error, misstatement or losses.

The Board confirms that there is an ongoing process of identifying, evaluating and managing all significant risks faced by the Group that has been in place for the year and up to the date of approval of this Statement for inclusion in the Integrated Report. The process is regularly reviewed by the Board and is in accordance with the Statement on Risk Management and Internal Control: Guidance for Directors of Listed Issuers (SRMICG) and the Group's Risk Management Policies and Procedures.

#### **RISK MANAGEMENT**

The risk management framework, which is embedded in the management systems of the Group, clearly defines the authority and accountability in implementing the risk management process and internal control system. The Management assists the Board in implementing the process of identifying, evaluating and managing significant risks applicable to their respective areas of business and in formulating suitable internal controls to mitigate and control these risks.

The Management is responsible for assessing and evaluating the feasibility and risk impact that prospective investments would have on the Group. For ongoing business operations, risk assessment and evaluation are an integral part of the annual business planning and budgeting process.

The Management of each business unit, in establishing its business objectives, is required to identify and document all possible risks that can affect their achievement, taking into consideration the effectiveness of controls that are capable of mitigating such risks.

- *\* Note: with Board representation*
- Feasibility study, risk impact and assessment on new investments/ projects is evaluated by the Management for the Board's deliberation.
- Internal control activities have been established in all business units with clearly defined lines of responsibilities, authority limits for major capital expenditure, contract awards and other significant transactions, segregation of duties, performance monitoring and safeguarding of assets.
- Systematically documented Policies and Procedures, Standard Operating Procedures are in place to guide employees in their dayto-day work. These Policies and Procedures are reviewed regularly and updated when necessary.
- As part of managing the day-to-day business operations, the Group uses a budgetary control system whereby all business units prepare business plans, budgets and control measures to mitigate identified risks. These business plans and budgets are reviewed and approved by the Budget Committee, which is chaired by the Group Managing Director and subsequently presented to the Board.
- A comprehensive reporting system comprising budgets, key business indicators and performance results on operations are made available to the Senior Management.

#### **REPORT SCOPE AND BOUNDARIES**

This report covers all business operations and activities of the Group where we have direct management control, unless otherwise specified. Namely, it includes all our subsidiaries in Malaysia, Australia and Vietnam, as well as our operations in Singapore and Taiwan as part of the expanded scope of this report. All entities in these countries listed in our 2024 Integrated Report are included in this report, except for our water concessions, joint ventures and associate companies. Some developments in the other countries we operate in are also included in this report. All human resourcesrelated data covers the entire Group, including operations in Malaysia, Australia, Vietnam, Singapore and Taiwan.

This year's report encompasses sustainability performance information for the period from 1 August 2023 to 31 July 2024 (FY2024). Due to the timing of this report's publication, any significant developments occurring after the conclusion of FY2024 have been included as appropriate. Our previous sustainability report was released on 9 November 2023.

Gamuda's ESG Impact Report follows established regulatory frameworks and international standards, ensuring transparent and accountable reporting of our sustainability performance. By aligning with recognised guidelines, we enhance stakeholder understanding of our commitment to responsible practices and sustainable development while meeting international regulatory expectations. This approach enables effective engagement with diverse stakeholders across the region. The report highlights our contributions to global sustainability goals and outlines our strategy for managing environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks, aiming to foster trust and collaboration with the communities we serve.

At Gamuda, sustainability is ingrained in our core values long before it became a global priority. We acknowledge our responsibility to the environment, communities, and stakeholders, and we seek opportunities to lead the industry in responsible growth.

Gamuda Berhad's ESG Impact Report 2024 offers a comprehensive overview of the Group's sustainability performance for the financial year 2024. We encourage readers to refer to the Gamuda ESG Pulse 2024 available at www.gamuda.com.my for additional insights, as this report is intended to be read alongside the sustainabilityrelated disclosures within the Integrated Report 2024.

Our commitment extends beyond financial impact and regulatory compliance. The consistency in driving lasting change is what has set us apart from the rest, where the Group is known for its strong focus on ESG in the construction and property sector.

**DRIVING MEANINGFUL CHANGE THROUGH PARTNERSHIPS**

The industry is often regarded as labour-intensive and more traditional in nature. We address these challenges by fostering strong partnerships with key stakeholders, particularly regulators and authorities to shape ESG guidelines into enforceable practices that benefit both business and sustainability. In recent times, we have been a key contributor industry initiative - TNFD sectoral guide, ASEAN Taxonomy Version 3, ISSB Standards for Sustainability Reporting, Capital Markets Malaysia's Simplified ESG Disclosure Guide, and Bursa Malaysia's Centralised Sustainability Intelligence solution.

In the context of our supply chain, we continue to collaborate with our partners to reduce their carbon footprint, enhance their economic impact, and increase their social contributions through community development and human rights initiatives. Furthermore, we have strengthened our ties with academia to develop new technologies, including those that enhance transparency in traceability.

#### **CLIMATE ACTION: OUR DEFAULT SETTING**

Decarbonisation remains a top priority, and we expand our investments in renewable energy sources like solar, hydropower, and wind. More importantly, we continue incorporating climate resilience and adaptation designs. This includes implementing greenhouse gases reduction measures, such as embodied carbon calculation, from construction to operation while ensuring our assets are protected against specific climate challenges.

We align our projects with standards and frameworks that are above standard requirements. Depending on the infrastructure or property development, we adopt standards prescribed by the Low Carbon Cities Framework (LCCF), Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment (BREEAM), Excellence in Design for Greater Efficiencies (EDGE), Infrastructure Sustainability Council (ISC), and Sustainable INFRASTAR, among others.

We are also actively exploring the application of generative artificial intelligence in enabling climate-resilient designs; life cycle and predictive analysis; environmental, biodiversity and social impact monitoring. Our efforts have put us on track in meeting the Green Gamuda Plan 2025, where we have achieved a 32% reduction as of FY2024.

#### **STEPPING UP CONTINUOUSLY**

We are making significant progress in social investment, particularly through our adoption of the Social Return on Investment (SROI) - the Social Value UK framework in 2023. This effort aligns with the latest Taskforce on Inequality and Social-related Financial Disclosures (TISFD). Our SROI ratio remains at 3.4, demonstrating our strong performance in the social sphere alongside our other ESG positive outcomes.

Throughout our sustainability journey, we have upheld transparency and credibility in our reporting, bolstering it further with external limited assurance in the past four years.

We are prepared to implement reporting aligned with global expectations, including the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and climate reporting for Australia. Thus far, we are the only Malaysian engineering and construction companies to adopt the TNFD, and to commit and submit data to the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) for validation.

Consequently, our ratings have improved in key ESG indexes such as the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices, MSCI, Sustainalytics and Bloomberg.

We were listed on FTSE4Good in December 2023. In June 2024, we were recognised as second-best company in Asia for ESG Overall by the Institutional Investor Research.

Not resting on our laurels, we will continue to pursue the Gamuda Green Plan 2025 that has set forth tangible targets until 2025, with an extended view to 2030 and beyond.

As a sustainable organisation with a global footprint across various regions, we actively contribute to the sustainable development of the local communities where we operate. We have been at the forefront of infrastructure development for over 40 years and have been dedicated to sustainable development for two decades. Our ongoing efforts are geared towards creating projects that leave long-lasting impacts for communities, as we strive to meet their needs and align with local sustainable development goals.

#### LOCALISING SUSTAINABILITY: OUR REGIONAL ESG IMPACT

#### **CLIMATE-RELATED TRANSITION RISKS**

As part of its commitment to Gamuda Green Plan 2025, the Group has prioritised decarbonisation as a key performance indicator, with active efforts to install solar panels and EV charging stations across our properties. The Group owns RM1,749 million in property and investment properties, of which RM1,342 million (77%) are equipped with renewable energy sources, such as solar panels, and green facilities, including EV charging stations. This leaves RM407 million (23%) of the Group's buildings and investment properties that have yet to be fully equipped with renewable energy sources and green facilities.

Moving forward, the Group will continue to assess the feasibility of installing renewable energy sources in the remaining group-owned properties. In line with the Gamuda Green Plan, the Group aims to retrofit buildings with solar solutions, enhance overall energy efficiency, adopt green construction technologies, and explore carbon offset mechanisms. Through these ongoing efforts, the Group is strengthening its commitment to sustainability, enhancing asset value, and building resilience against climate-related risks.

To address these risks, the Group is committed to ongoing innovation and value engineering in design, aiming to reduce vulnerabilities and enhance adaptive capacity. The Group actively monitors climate-related risks, embedding resilience considerations into its long-term strategic planning and risk management processes to ensure alignment with both environmental and business sustainability goals.

#### **CLIMATE-RELATED OPPORTUNITIES**

The Group has been actively exploring climate-related opportunities to enhance its portfolio of sustainable assets. In 2021, the Group entered

#### CLIMATE RISK AND OPPORTUNITY: IN ALIGNMENT TO INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING

# STANDARDS (IFRS S2)

**CLIMATE-RELATED PHYSICAL RISKS** Gamuda has consistently conducted comprehensive risk assessments and integrated climate resilience measures into project designs to safeguard its operations. Among the climate-related physical risks assessed, the most relevant to current local operations is the risk of flooding, particularly for projects located in low-lying areas. Potential impacts include operational disruptions and elevated maintenance costs. Currently, approximately RM6.7 million of plant and equipment is situated at sites identified as prone to flooding. Gamuda has invested a total of RM8 million in green infrastructure, including solar panels and EV charging facilities in Malaysia. This investment includes RM1.6 million for installations at Menara Gamuda and RM0.8 million for enhancements at the Next Generation IBS in Banting. Additionally, we have allocated RM5.6 million for similar installations across our property portfolio in various townships. To further support its sustainability goals, Gamuda has invested approximately RM0.7 million since 2021 in training and development related to sustainable construction practices. These efforts demonstrate Gamuda's commitment to transitioning to greener energy solutions.

the solar infrastructure sector through acquiring a stake in ERS, with one of the partnership's projects, the Neda Pekan Project, projected to generate an average yearly revenue of RM7.7 million over the next 20 years, beginning in FY2025. Additionally, Gamuda has entered into a joint venture to develop the 187.5 MW Ulu Padas Hydroelectric Project in Tenom, Sabah and to propose a floating solar solution to integrate with the project for Sabah Energy Corporation Sdn Bhd. This RM3.0 billion initiative is expected to contribute significantly to the national grid and support sustainable energy generation in Sabah.

In Australia, through its subsidiary DT Infrastructure, the Group secured a contract to construct the Boulder Creek Wind Farm project, valued at AUD243 million (approximately RM702 million). This project will bolster Queensland's efforts to reach its electricity generation target of 50 percent overall supply from renewables by 2030. Through these strategic projects, Gamuda continues to position itself at the forefront of climate-resilient infrastructure, aligning with global efforts for a sustainable future.

#### **CAPITAL DEPLOYMENT**

#### **REMUNERATION**

Gamuda's commitment to good governance ensures transparency, accountability, and responsible growth while addressing environmental and social challenges. Guided by our ESG Policy Statement and the Gamuda Green Plan 2025, we uphold high ethical standards to protect stakeholder interests and align with global sustainability goals. Our governance practices, endorsed by the Board, foster a strong compliance culture across all operations, ensuring ethical practices are embedded throughout the Group.

For more information on Gamuda's governance, ethics and integrity, please refer to the Corporate Governance Overview Statement o[n page 90 o](#page-46-0)f this report.

#### **GAMUDA SUSTAINABILITY GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE**

Gamuda upholds a robust sustainability governance framework that is essential for reaching our sustainability goals. By integrating ESG principles into our core business strategy and decision-making, we ensure high standards across all operations. Our approach aligns with directives from Bursa Malaysia and the Securities Commission Malaysia, supporting the 12th Malaysia Plan's focus on ESG adoption in both public and private sectors.

Gamuda's Board of Directors has significantly deepened its involvement in ESG matters in recent years. Alongside the Sustainability Steering Committee (SSC), the Board oversees our high-level policies and sustainability responsibilities. This oversight enables the Board to maintain a comprehensive understanding of sustainability issues relevant to the Group and our regional operations.

The Board ensures that material topics such as climate change, biodiversity, human rights, and supply chain management are fully integrated into the Group's strategic direction, applying these principles across all business divisions and regions. They actively engage in reviewing the Group's materiality assessments and evaluate its performance in managing sustainability risks and opportunities. This includes addressing potential ESG-related events, from environmental threats like floods and sea level rise to social issues such as employee health and safety and governance challenges such as technology and cybersecurity. Additionally, the Board is responsible for determining appropriate remuneration for directors and management.

The Board is supported by dedicated individuals and committees, including the Risk Management Committee (RMC), Group Chief ESG Officer, the SSC and subject matter experts. The Group Chief ESG Officer leads the management of Gamuda's sustainability strategies and the Gamuda sustainability team carries out its day-to-day implementation.

#### **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**

As part of our performance assessment, Gamuda assigns ESG Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to all employees including executive management. Currently, at least **20 percent** of employees' performance is **linked to ESG performance**. These KPIs include the reduction of Gamuda's energy intensity, diverting waste from landfills, water conservation, safety performance, demonstrating integrity and upholding governance principles and compulsory annual training on mandatory policies. The digitalisation of our ESG platforms has enabled the **tracking and archiving of all ESG data** across the Group, facilitating the linkage of ESG KPIs to performance. The Board maintains oversight of performance-linked ESG targets and remuneration of all our management and employees.

#### <span id="page-65-0"></span>SUSTAINABILITY GOVERNANCE

Preventing bribery and corruption within our organisation is essential to building trust and mitigating legal, financial and reputational risks whilst fostering a fair business environment. Our commitment to compliance is demonstrated through the enforcement of key policies such as the Anti-Bribery and Corruption (AB&C) Policy, Whistleblowing Policy and Procedure (WBPP) and Code of Business Ethics (COBE).

In line with Section 17A of the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) Act, Gamuda has proactively strengthened its Corporate Liability Framework and Integrity & Governance policies. This includes the Gamuda Organisational Anti-Corruption Plan (OACP), which is revised every three years and aligned with Malaysia's National Anti-Corruption Strategy (NACS) 2024–2028. Launched by Prime Minister YAB Dato' Seri Anwar Bin Ibrahim, the NACS emphasises transparency and accountability in combating corruption.

We maintain a zero-tolerance stance on bribery and expect all stakeholders, including business partners, to uphold the same ethical standards. Our AB&C Policy is actively communicated through various channels. External communication includes contractual agreements and compliance via the ARIBA system, while internal communication consists of email blasts, training and awareness sessions and an annual Integrity Pledge. The policy is accessible to all employees through the Employee Management System. External stakeholders can access it via the Gamuda website.

#### **MITIGATING BRIBERY AND CORRUPTION-RELATED RISKS**

As part of our mitigation efforts, the Group's Integrity and Governance Unit (IGU) conducts bribery and corruption risk assessments across the Group. Led by the Chief Integrity and Governance Officer (CIGO), the IGU oversees the internal corruption monitoring system, ensuring that the AB&C Policy commitments are upheld in all activities. The monitoring system encompasses operating guidelines for record-keeping, relevant policies and procedures, as well as expected appropriate behaviour.

In addition, we ensure due diligence procedures are taken before engaging any new suppliers, partners or associates. Other than requiring them to adhere to the Group's AB&C Policy, the due diligence process includes:

- Conducting background checks
- Evaluating the integrity of potential suppliers by mandating suppliers to submit written commitments through Gamuda's digital supplier platform
- Educating suppliers on the AB&C Policy requirements and the importance of corporate integrity in business culture

#### **WHISTLEBLOWING MECHANISM**

The Group's Whistleblowing Policy and Procedures serves as a confidential or anonymous mechanism for our stakeholders. It provides stakeholders with a secure and confidential platform to report any suspicious wrongdoing, misconduct or non-compliance with the Group's policies without fear of reprisal or dismissal.

We have in place a comprehensive procedure that ensures every reported incident is thoroughly investigated by an independent team. The procedure and investigating teams are overseen by the CIGO. Stakeholders can file their reports through integrityline@gamuda.com.my.

#### **Process For Raising and Addressing Whistleblowing**

![](_page_66_Picture_13.jpeg)

For more information on Gamuda's supplier evaluation, please refer to Supply Chain Management on [page 134 o](#page-68-0)f this report.

To enhance our anti-corruption measures, we have conducted training programmes consistently over the years, with more than 6 percent of employees completing live training in the 2023-2024 financial year alone. This figure reflects this year's participation, while the cumulative number of employees who have undertaken the training over the years is significantly higher. Malaysia is at an 11 percent completion rate this year and all directors have completed 100 percent of the required training. As we continue to expand our operations regionally, we will prioritise intensifying training efforts and extending our corporate governance initiatives to new markets to ensure consistent adherence to ethical standards.

Over the past year, Gamuda recorded a total of six confirmed incidents through whistleblowing reports. Of these, five cases have been successfully resolved, highlighting the robustness of our grievance handling procedures. The remaining case is currently ongoing, with appropriate actions being taken to ensure a fair and timely resolution.

#### **SECURING SUSTAINABLE FINANCING**

In August 2022, Gamuda Land successfully secured sustainable financing from Public Bank Bhd for its green-accredited residential and commercial projects. This achievement follows a green financing memorandum of understanding with Public Bank, reflecting their commitment to attain carbon neutrality by 2030 and net zero emissions by 2050. To enhance accessibility to green financing for homeowners, Gamuda Land will ensure all its properties are certified by recognised bodies, the Green Building Index (GBI) and Green Real Estate (GreenRE).

Following that, Amanat Lebuhraya Rakyat Bhd (ALR) acquired Gamuda's highway toll concessions, including SPRINT, SMART, LITRAK and KESAS in October 2022. This landmark deal was facilitated by ALR's Sustainability Sukuk, a Shariah-compliant bond with a nominal

In line with the Indigenous Procurement Policy (IPP) and the Aboriginal Procurement Policy (APP) of New South Wales, Gamuda has allocated over **AUD47 million for the procurement of goods and services from Aboriginal businesses** across three major projects in Australia:

This practice aligns with Gamuda Australia's Social Procurement Policy, the NSW Aboriginal Procurement Policy and the Federal Indigenous Procurement Policy, contributing to the broader goals of fostering Indigenous entrepreneurship and economic development.

#### AUD35.1 million

dedicated to 38 Aboriginal Businesses through WTP project

#### AUD4 million

allocated through M1 project for 12 Aboriginal Businesses

#### AUD7.9 million

channelled to 26 Aboriginal Businesses for the Coffs Harbour Bypass project

The UN Environment Programme reports that supply chains account for up to 90 percent of a company's environmental impact, while the International Labour Organisation highlights that about 20 percent of global supply chains fall short of labour standards. For Gamuda, effective supply chain management enhances operational efficiency while addressing environmental and social responsibilities.

By focusing on robust practices, Gamuda aims to optimise procurement, reduce costs and minimise its environmental footprint. This strategic approach aligns operations with socio-economic expectations, reinforces ethical practices and fosters a resilient supply chain that supports long-term success and promotes environmental stewardship and social equity.

Our suppliers are expected to comply with all the relevant local and international regulations where we operate. They are also required to uphold ethical business practices that are consistent with our policies and procedures, including but not limited to:

- Code of Business Ethics
- Human Rights Policy
- Quality, Safety, Health and Environment (QSHE) Policy
- Social Procurement Policy by Gamuda Australia

Furthermore, all our suppliers are required to adhere to the environmental standards that are outlined in our contractual agreements. The QSHE and procurement teams oversee the monitoring of suppliers' environmental performance, ensuring their environmental commitments and targets align with the Gamuda Green Plan 2025. For potential suppliers, they must provide their policies, company code of conduct and relevant sustainability certificates (where applicable). They must also agree to comply with our Anti-Bribery and Corruption (AB&C) Policy before being appointed.

Additionally, we assess our suppliers on an annual basis, whereby the findings are systematically captured in our Ariba system. These assessments inform our supplier engagement approaches, allowing us to proactively mitigate risks associated with non-compliance. This methodology aligns with our ESG commitments, reflecting our dedication to supporting our suppliers and promoting long-term sustainability within our supply chain.

# VALUE TO THE PEOPLE

{77}------------------------------------------------

Investing in human capital is more critical than ever. The International Labour Organization (ILO) estimates that businesses prioritising skills development and employee well-being see productivity gains of up to 20 percent, while the World Economic Forum predicts that over one billion people will need reskilling by 2030 to meet the demands of the future workforce. In this rapidly evolving landscape, a company's ability to nurture and develop its talent is key to staying competitive and innovative.

We continuously invest in workforce development, ensuring our employees are equipped to thrive in a rapidly changing industry. This commitment enhances employee satisfaction, fosters innovation and creates a culture of excellence. By offering comprehensive development programmes and equal opportunities for all, we support the career growth of both white-collar and blue-collar workers, ensuring our talent remains strong and future-ready.

#### **OUR WORKFORCE AT A GLANCE**

In the region, Gamuda had a total of 6,053 employees in FY2024, an increase from 4,219 in FY2023. This growth is partly due to the expansion of our reporting boundary to include the 2023 Australian acquisition, as well as Singapore and Taiwan.

#### **BUILDING AN INCLUSIVE WORKFORCE**

Gamuda understands our role as we work towards gender equity across our operations. As of FY2024, we have 2,089 women employees across the Group making up 35 percent of our total workforce. At the Board level, four of our seven members are women. Across all levels, women make up at least 30 percent of the workforce by employee category. Notably, we have a high number of women employees at the executive level, making up 46 percent of all executives working at Gamuda.

We offer employees equal pay for equal work, regardless of gender, and we continue to encourage and empower women to take leadership roles

in various areas of our operations.

Gamuda prioritises the hiring of local workers for our projects in all of our countries of operation and places a strong emphasis on developing a diverse workforce with multilingual employees from varying ethnic backgrounds.

#### <span id="page-78-0"></span>**NEW EMPLOYEE HIRING AND TURNOVER**

We are dedicated to hiring and promoting individuals based on merit, respecting the rights of every employee regardless of their background, and actively fostering an inclusive workplace that values diversity. Having the right talent attraction and retention strategy optimises the hiring-to-turnover ratio, helping to maintain high morale. In addition to our Group's human capital policies, which uphold and protect the rights of all employees, our efforts are guided by two key policies that establish structured processes for recruiting new talent and managing service cessation.

![](_page_78_Figure_16.jpeg)

Our **Recruitment and Selection Policy** ensures a structured process for hiring, supported by initiatives to build talent pools and retain employees through rewards and growth opportunities. We expand our talent pool through partnerships with educational institutions, offering scholarships and upskilling programmes. Graduates receive job placements and leadership training, forming a junior talent pipeline. Many have progressed into senior leadership roles. Additionally, our Employee Referral Programme invites employees to recommend candidates, enhancing internal career advancement alongside upskilling initiatives.

Our **Cessation of Service Policy** manages employee resignations through formal exit interviews to gather feedback and address workplace shortcomings. Our hiring processes are audited annually under ISO 9001, with no non-compliance found in FY2024. We will continue enhancing employee engagement through training, workshops, town halls and special briefings. Additional initiatives like our training centres, LinkedIn Learning access, flexible work arrangements and open access to Gamuda Clinic aim to reduce turnover and create an inclusive, fulfilling environment for employees of all ages.

Human rights are fundamental protections everyone deserves. With 1.5 million victims of modern slavery and 73 million children in child labour annually, businesses must act to respect and protect these rights. As a multi-regional organisation, Gamuda is committed to embedding human rights principles in all our operations, ensuring the well-being of employees, suppliers, and communities. This commitment strengthens our ethical practices, fosters a positive work environment and upholds our social license to operate. By prioritising human rights, we contribute to a fairer society while reinforcing our operational integrity and long-term success.

We demonstrate our commitment to human rights by providing a working environment that is safe as well as conducive, facilitating employee engagement and retention. In addition, we also build a sustainable supply chain by requiring our third-party vendors and contractors to adhere to best practices that are in line with our standards. We reinforce this by mandating our third-party vendors and suppliers to sign an agreement affirming their agreement and compliance with our Human Rights Policy, conducting regular audits and risk assessments, in addition to providing confidential reporting channels. In Australia, contractors and vendors are required to conform to our policies as well as the rules of the Fair Work Ombudsman (FWO). Our project managers, business heads and human resource team are responsible for ensuring that our subsidiaries, contractors as well as third-party providers adopt responsible labour practices.

We also respect the rights of migrant workers by taking steps to prevent forced labour and modern slavery while ensuring that they are treated

with dignity.

Guided by the Group's overarching Human Rights Policy, our commitment to upholding human rights is aligned with the International Labour Organization (ILO). We do not condone or partake in any work or service from any person that is not offered voluntarily or offered under duress. To effectively integrate our commitment to human rights throughout our operations, we provide human rights training to relevant employees when required.

#### **OUR HUMAN RIGHTS POLICY**

Our Human Rights Policy is reviewed and updated periodically to align with the latest labour laws, with the most recent update completed in October 2023. The policy, along with human rights expectations, are clearly communicated to all stakeholders, including business partners, via the Corporate Governance section of Gamuda's website as well as our internal platforms. Our business partners are educated on the policy when they are onboarded onto our Group-wide digital procurement system. They are required to sign a pledge committing to align their activities with our Human Rights policy.

#### **FREE, PRIOR AND INFORMED CONSENT (FPIC)**

We are committed to seeking the Free Prior, and Informed Consent (FPIC) of Indigenous peoples in matters that may affect them, ensuring they are kept informed and involved in decisions and actions impacting their communities. Our approach is grounded in building strong, long-lasting relationships with Indigenous communities based on mutual respect, meaningful engagement and trust. We respect the rights of Indigenous peoples in line with the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, including groups such as the *Orang Asli* and *Orang Asal* in Malaysia and First Nations peoples in Australia.

In addition, we will be teaming up with an Indigenous-based civil society group to develop the Upper Padas Social Impact Management Plan (UPSIMP). The plan includes establishing FPIC, an updated social baseline as well as developing benefit-sharing and community development plans. The UPSIMP will also include social training to ensure the project team is respectful towards the surrounding local communities.

#### **EQUAL COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS**

We are dedicated to offering fair compensation and benefits in line with the minimum wage requirements of each country where we operate and

we respect the right to collective bargaining.

Since FY2022, we have revised our starting salary for local workers to RM1,800 and for foreign workers to RM1,600. This exceeds the minimum wage of RM1,500 that was raised following the amendment of the Employment Act in 2022. We have also increased the starting pay for fresh engineering graduates from RM3,300 to RM3,500 and for non-engineering graduates from RM3,000 to RM3,200, which increased the minimum amount for the next salary band.

We strive to go beyond regulatory compliance by providing comprehensive benefits that promote work-life balance. Our permanent employees are eligible for our full suite of benefits. We also extend some of our benefits to those who work with us part-time and temporarily. They qualify for leave, insurance coverage and medical expenses claims. Our benefits cover healthcare, wellness and retirement.

We have established a Whistleblowing Policy that provides a comprehensive system for receiving, documenting and addressing complaints or grievances. This policy serves as a confidential reporting channel for all internal and external stakeholders, including employees, suppliers, contractors and others impacted by our business activities. It allows them to safely and anonymously disclose any misconduct within the Group.

Concerns can be reported to the whistleblowing hotline at integrityline@gamuda.com.my. Upon receipt, the CIGO will review the initial report and direct it to the appropriate parties. If the report pertains to bribery or corruption, it will be addressed by the Integrity and Governance Unit.

In FY2024, we recorded one incident of harassment, which was resolved after a thorough investigation. This case was managed in accordance with our internal procedures and the Whistleblowing Policy, emphasising our commitment to addressing all forms of misconduct seriously and effectively. We regularly review our processes to uphold the integrity of our reporting system.

#### **RESPECTING THE RIGHTS OF MIGRANT WORKERS**

We are committed to ensuring the dignified and respectful treatment of all migrant workers who work on our operations, including directly contracted or subcontracted workers.

Gamuda's AMS (Anti-Modern Slavery) Task Force was established to safeguard against forced labour and modern slavery within our operations and supply chain. As part of its role, the AMS Task Force conducts regular audits and activities to raise awareness throughout our operations. This includes conducting risk assessments with respect to labour issues for both existing operations and due diligence for potential projects or operations. The unit also provides channels for foreign workers to give feedback, raise concerns and lodge complaints.

We take a direct approach to hiring foreign labour by sourcing workers directly from their home countries, bypassing third-party agents. This Globally, the importance of Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) cannot be overstated. The International Labour Organization (ILO) reports that more than 2.7 million workers die annually due to occupational accidents or work-related diseases, while hundreds of millions more suffer non-fatal injuries. These alarming figures highlight the critical need for businesses to prioritise safety and health as a cornerstone of sustainable operations. A safe workplace not only protects lives but also ensures long-term business resilience and productivity.

At Gamuda, we place OSH at the heart of our operations, recognising that safeguarding our workers' well-being is essential for fostering a positive work culture and maintaining operational excellence. By creating a secure and healthy work environment, we demonstrate our commitment to caring for and respecting our employees. A strong OSH framework allows our workforce to remain focused, minimising errors and reducing the likelihood of accidents. This, in turn, lowers the risk of disruptions to our projects, resulting in improved efficiency and productivity.

At Gamuda, we go beyond complying with the requirements of the markets we operate in to ensure that any and all stakeholders at our work sites and assets are safe. Our approach to OSH is guided by our Quality, Safety, Health and Environmental (QSHE) policy, which encompasses workplace safety, occupational diseases and environmental impact. It also ensures that we comply with the relevant laws and regulations in the countries we operate.

The policy sets out guidelines for managing OSH through a systematic, covering health, safety and well-being, including occupational diseases. We review our policy periodically and benchmark our performance against industry best practices in the countries where we operate, while aligning to local regulations. Key to implementing our QSHE policy is our ISO-certified OSH and Environmental management systems that is monitored and executed by a dedicated team across all our existing projects. As of 2024, all our project sites are certified with ISO 14001:2015 Environmental Management Systems and ISO 45001:2018 Occupational Health and Safety Management Systems.

We aim to achieve zero employee injuries through safe work methods besides preventing occupational diseases and minimising our environmental impact. We encourage our employees, suppliers and contractors to adhere to and uphold our QSHE policy while ensuring the integration of QSHE requirements into our daily operations. By upholding these principles, we not only enhance operational safety but also contribute to the overall well-being of all stakeholders involved in our projects

To proactively minimise risk, we identify potential hazards early, allowing us to implement risk mitigation measures that reduce the risk of accidents and disruptions to our operations. This includes conducting daily safety and health briefings at all worksites.

#### SAFETY AND HEALTH

#### **Key Impacts**

In FY2024, there were zero substantiated complaints concerning human rights violations.

Audits by Gamuda's Anti-Modern Slavery Unit found that all central labour quarters were **100 percent** compliant with The Worker's Minimum standards of Housing and Amenities Act 2019, while the treatment of all local and foreign workers were found to be **100 percent** in compliance with the Employment Act.

# **Integrating Key Performance Indicators**

Our group-wide OSH objectives are driven by quantifiable Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), classified into leading and lagging indicators. It falls upon every employee to fulfil these KPIs. Each of the project's KPI are monitored and subsequently its performance are reported to the management on monthly basis. This provides the management relevant information to discern areas for improvement and approve continual improvement programme. The KPIs encompass the following:

Annual **zero** lost time incidents (LTI)

Achieve more than **85 percent** of internally set QSHE objectives and targets

Achieve **zero** non-compliance reports for Audit and Inspection

Compliance with **regulatory requirements**

![](_page_81_Picture_34.jpeg)

We ensure full compliance with applicable occupational safety and health regulations across all our operations, adhering to legal frameworks that mandate the protection of workers' health, safety and welfare. These laws require employers, employees and stakeholders to take proactive measures to maintain safe work environments, enforce safety protocols and ensure accountability for the well-being of all individuals at our worksites.

method significantly reduces the risk of exploitative practices such as wage bondage or slavery, which are often perpetuated by recruitment agencies that charge exorbitant fees or impose unfair contractual terms on workers. By engaging directly with the workers, we ensure transparency in the recruitment process and uphold their rights, providing them with fair wages, clear contract terms and safe working conditions. This also empowers the workers by removing the financial burden of agency fees, reducing their vulnerability to debt bondage.

During the pandemic, Gamuda became a pioneer in Malaysia by providing high-quality Centralised Labour Quarters (CLQs) for all its migrant workers, setting a new standard for worker accommodations. These quarters were built with the workers' welfare in mind, ensuring safe, comfortable living conditions. Additionally, Gamuda set up Centralised Quarantine Quarters (CQQs) within the CLQs for workers who tested positive for COVID-19. This initiative helped maintain health protocols, mitigate the risk of outbreaks and allowed operations to continue during lockdowns.

#### **OSH MANAGEMENT APPROACH**

Yayasan Gamuda, in partnership with Gamuda Clinic, continued its efforts to provide essential healthcare services to the *Orang Asli* and underserved communities throughout 2024. With a special focus on children and promoting self-care, our healthcare outreach benefitted 2,963 individuals across *Orang Asli* and underserved communities with 480 hours served through our healthcare outreach.

We conduct regular outreach sessions every month and revisit the communities every three to six months to raise awareness about key health issues within the community. In addition to administering care, we issue referral letters when further medical attention is required.

Our outreach emphasises the importance of healthy eating habits and proper dental hygiene, delivering education on these topics to all age groups, from children to adults.

In addition to serving the *Orang Asli*, we extended our healthcare outreach through period visits to underprivileged areas. This year, we extended our healthcare programme to the communities surrounding Buku Jalanan Chow Kit, ensuring vital medical support reaches even more underserved populations.

Apart from stringent safety policies and measures, we prioritise OSH by providing on-site healthcare services. Our Gamuda Clinic, located in our headquarters in Kuala Lumpur, has implemented various initiatives to ensure immediate access to healthcare at the workplace. These initiatives include:

- Conducting health screening programmes for non-communicable diseases at various Gamuda sites, including Gamuda Cove, Gamuda Gardens and Quayside Tower.
- Offering screening and treatment at the clinic located at the Group's headquarters for infectious diseases (e.g. Tuberculosis, Influenza, COVID-19).
- Setting up medical sickbay staffed by qualified paramedics and medical officers at our construction sites.
- Our medical team comprising professional paramedics, medical assistants and first aiders are been deployed at FunPark and SplashMania water theme park to ensure the safety and well-being of our guests.

#### **Healthcare Services beyond Employees**

In addition, we have a Pandemic Response Plan in place to manage outbreaks effectively, ensuring the safety and health of our employees. Furthermore, we have developed comprehensive emergency preparedness plans that include response strategies for various global health and environmental issues that could affect employee health and disrupt operations. For instance, we have a Haze Management Policy to protect our workers from exposure to haze, which can cause respiratory problems and impact their health.

#### **Occupational Health Approaches and Services**

#### **Safety Training and Engagement**

Our workers receive hours of training in OSH to mitigate and minimise injuries on site. Each training session ranges from two to four hours, with classroom training sessions taking up to eight hours per session, to ensure that instructors have sufficient time to delve into each topic.

We provide our workers a general safety orientation, where we introduce them to the necessary workplace safety practices and safety protocols that are practised by Gamuda. We also ensure that our workers receive training in areas such as first aid, CPR, fire safety, usage of personal protective equipment, emergency response, as well as mental health and awareness. In addition, we provide workers with specialised training for specific tasks such as working inside pipelines and working at heights. Other than that, we have trained 30 employees from Township, Mall Management, Park Management, and Club Operations in Malaysia as Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) Coordinators. These representatives will address OSH-related matters within their respective areas, in alignment with the Occupational Safety and Health (Amendment) Act 2022.

#### **Integrated Management System and OSH Management**

Our holistic OSH Management System (OSHMS) is part of our Integrated Management System (IMS). Certified to ISO 45001:2018 – Occupational Safety and Health Management Systems, the OSHMS covers all our employees, including workers of contractors and subcontractors. All our consultants, architects, contractors and service providers are required to comply with the safety guidelines embedded within our contractual agreements, which must be signed before they are appointed.

#### **OSH Monitoring and Evaluation Essentials**

Our commitment to maintaining the highest safety, health and environmental (SHE) standards is demonstrated through our disciplined audit approach, ensuring our practices stay in line with the most recent industry standards. SHE officers carry out inspection of project sites on a daily, weekly and monthly basis in addition to audits conducted on a monthly basis for all sites. Monthly Environmental, Health and Safety (EHS) meetings, led by the senior project manager and involving safety officers, employee representatives, and construction managers, reinforce the Group's commitment to a safe and inclusive workplace. The QSHE Monthly Report documents the assessment of project Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), which are set and reviewed during monthly meetings.

We use the Safety and Health Assessment System in Construction (SHASSIC), an independent method for evaluating the safety and health performance of contractors in construction projects based on the Construction Industry Standard (CIS 10:2020). Before appointing contractors, we assess their safety performance and risks. Their performance is then monitored through regular worksite inspections to mitigate risks and ensure compliance with safety protocols.

Gamuda strives to have zero Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate (LTIFR). We are committed to continuous improvement and aim for zero accidents or incidents leading to injuries or fatalities by 2025. In addition to this, we conduct trend analysis of our safety and health performance and comparing our performance against benchmarks from Malaysia, Singapore and Australia.

#### **Participation, Consultation and Communication on OSH**

OSH responsibilities are cascaded down the Group's levels of employees. Ultimate responsibility for OSH performance lies with the senior leadership, who are supported by a dedicated central support team that drives the OSH programme. This team is tasked with the implementation, monitoring and reporting of all OSH issues to the senior leadership. KPIs of project sites, business units, leaders and OSH representatives are also linked to OSH performance.

Every site has a dedicated OSH representative, who is trained and equipped with the necessary competencies to manage incident reporting processes as well as inspections.

A SHE committee is established to develop a safe working environment and to review safety and health procedures at workplace. All our employees sites to ensure the health and safety of workers. It conducts regular safety walkabouts and holds monthly meetings, or whenever necessary. While each committee has an equal number of management and employee representatives, all workers are nevertheless welcome to attend the meetings or provide feedback to improve the OSH at worksites.

Actions are reviewed by management and reported to the Board quarterly or as needed

#### **Continuous Improvement**

Policies, Risk Assessments are been revised and training is enhanced based on the incident outcomes

**Initial Response**

Emergency procedures are activated and impact is minimised

In Gamuda Australia, OSH is guided by its Health, Safety and Quality Strategy (2023 – 2025), which covers the following five key areas, ensuring a comprehensive OSH system for its employees.

#### **DRIVING SAFETY EXCELLENCE: RISK ASSESSMENTS AND DATA-DRIVEN INSIGHTS:**

#### **Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment**

#### **Business Intelligence Data Visualisation Software**

We utilise business intelligence data visualisation software for safety and health data analysis. This enables real-time monitoring and detailed examination, improving our ability to respond swiftly to emerging risks. The software integrates seamlessly with various data sources, ensuring comprehensive up-to-date information, thereby assisting us in enhancing workplace safety and health management.

#### **Building Information Modelling (BIM)**

We conduct safety and health risk assessments throughout all stages across all of our projects. Additionally, we perform due diligence on sites before work begins to identify potential safety and health risks and develop effective mitigation plans. In Gamuda Australia, the Head of Projects leads risk workshops to develop the Project Risk Assessment (PRA). This PRA, which identifies hazards and assesses risks, guides the development of Safe Work Method Statements (SWMS), ensuring legal compliance. The PRA is reviewed quarterly and whenever changes occur. It is also provided to subcontractors to align their SWMS for safety and compliance. Managing safety by fostering a safety markets where we operate.

> BIM significantly enhances safety in construction and building management. By improving planning, communication, risk mitigation, training, documentation and ongoing maintenance, BIM contributes to safer work environments. The incorporation of BIM into safety practices leads to early identification of potential hazards, as well as efficient, secure and successful construction projects.

#### **Incident Investigation**

Gamuda uses an incident reporting system to keep track of accidents, injuries and fatalities among our workers. We thoroughly investigate all incidents, including near misses. All incidents are reported to project management representatives and escalated to the head of the project or client representative when necessary.

#### **Gamuda's Incident Investigation and Management Protocol**

In the event of a fatality, immediate notification is made to the general manager, Executive Directors and Client. All incidents of fatality are also reported to the Board. For all other incidents, they are informed through an Incident Alert and QSHE Monthly Report. Safety protocols and incident data are independently verified by third-party auditors to ensure transparency as well as accountability. Additionally, we benchmark our safety performance against industry standards in the

#### **Incident Reporting for our Employees and Contractors**

We acknowledge our obligation to ensure the safety of everyone across our sites, including those not directly employed by us. This primarily refers to contractors working at our various locations. All contractors are required to adhere to the safety guidelines outlined in their contractual agreements, which must be signed prior to engagement.

Objectives and targets related to employee and contractor safety are integrated into our overall safety and health objectives, with a focus on achieving zero Lost Time Injuries (LTIs) and minimising Non-Conformance Reports (NCRs). Safety management is reported internally through our Integrated Management System (IMS) and Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) guidelines, ensuring transparency and accountability across all operational levels.

In FY2024, a total of four employee incidents were reported. Of these, three were minor incidents involving slips, trips, and contact with sharp objects, leading to lacerations that required medical aid and stiches. In these cases, the employees returned to work on the same day. One incident resulted in a lost time injury due to contact with moving machinery, which required further medical assessment.

For our contractors, nine incidents were reported. Of these, five incidents required medical aid for minor injuries, including cuts from exposed objects, falls, and strains from missteps. The more severe cases involved a wrist and forearm injury from a falling object, fractures during formwork shifting, a foot injury from stepping into a trench, and an electrocution incident.

In all instances, workers received immediate medical attention, and appropriate remedial actions were implemented. These included additional training, site compliance inspections, audits, and the installation of mitigation measures where necessary. We also enhanced our existing Safe Work Method Statements (SWMS) for the affected work activities. Notably, in FY2024, there were no employee or contractor fatalities.

#### **TASK FORCE ON CLIMATE-RELATED FINANCIAL DISCLOSURES (TCFD)**

The TCFD aims to enhance transparency in climate-related financial disclosures, as it provides companies with a framework to deliver consistent and reliable climate-related information. This allows organisations to integrate climate considerations into their financial planning and reporting processes, ultimately enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions. The globally recognised framework focuses on four key areas: Governance, Strategy, Risk Management and Metrics and Targets.

Since 2021, we have been aligning our climate disclosures with the recommendations of the TCFD, and in 2022, we officially became a supporter of the TCFD. To ensure consistent enhancements of our climate disclosures, we stay updated with the latest changes in international climate reporting frameworks. We are aware of the incorporation of TCFD recommendations into the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS S1 and IFRS S2) released by the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB). As such, we have aligned our disclosures with selected indicators of IFRS S2 (Climate Change Disclosure) into our climate report as part of our transition to IFRS. We aim to fully align our reporting with IFRS S1 and S2 moving forward. Additionally, we will align its reporting on ESG and climate matters with the recently announced National Sustainability Reporting Framework from the Ministry of Finance by 2025/2026.

#### **REDUCING EMISSIONS AND ENERGY CONSUMPTION**

Guided by our overarching Gamuda Green Plan, we are actively striving to reduce the consumption of fossil fuels and embrace cleaner energy to drive the shift towards a low-carbon economy.

For more information on our TCFD disclosures, refer to pages 215 to 220.

Our FY2024 energy and emissions reduction initiatives are as follows:

![](_page_93_Picture_21.jpeg)

![](_page_93_Picture_22.jpeg)

![](_page_93_Picture_23.jpeg)

Recognising the importance of Scope 3 emissions, we have engaged our supply chain partners since 2011 to promote sustainable practices through training sessions and set emission reduction targets. This includes encouraging suppliers to use low-carbon technologies, improve waste management and optimise logistics to reduce transportation emissions.

We will regularly track our progress and adjust our strategies as needed to meet our GHG reduction targets. Through these actions, we aim to reduce our carbon footprint and contribute positively to global climate efforts.

#### **Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi)**

The SBTi provides a framework for companies to set ambitious climate goals that are in line with the latest climate science, which is crucial for limiting global warming and mitigating climate change. Gamuda's commitment to these targets can help set a precedent for other companies in Malaysia and beyond.

In 2022, we became one of the **first two Malaysian companies in the construction and engineering sector to adopt the SBTi**, aligning our GHG reduction goals with scientific evidence and global climate commitments.

As of FY2024, we are the **only Malaysian company in the construction and engineering sector** that has submitted our GHG emissions targets to SBTi, which are currently pending validation. We acknowledge that much still needs to be done to achieve net zero and will continue to enhance the management of our GHG emissions.

In line with these efforts, our emission intensity performance has shown significant improvement over the past year. Through reduction in energy use, enhanced energy-efficiency and increased utilisation of renewable energy, we have successfully reduced our emissions intensity by 32 percent in FY2024 compared to our baseline in FY2022. This progress demonstrates our ongoing commitment to reducing our carbon footprint and aligning with global sustainability targets, ensuring long-term value to the environment.

#### **OUR LOW CARBON CITY PROGRESS**

For Gamuda, the commitment to reducing carbon emissions is a continuous and integral part of our strategy to develop low-carbon cities. To date, we have achieved the following progress:

#### **Installation of Solar PV Panels**

At Gamuda Berhad, the installation of solar PV systems has become standard practice, reflecting our ongoing commitment to reducing Scope 2 emissions and supporting sustainable development. This approach is now an integral part of our operational framework. For instance, we have implemented solar photovoltaic (PV) panels across various Gamuda Land assets, including Experience Galleries and SplashMania Water Theme Park, with a total of 11,252 solar PVs installed across 17 sites, achieving a combined capacity of 5,722 kilowatt peak (kWp).

Additionally, mobile solar panels have been introduced at our construction sites, such as the Queensland Train Maintenance Project (QTMP) and the Waurn Ponds Duplication Project, which are utilising solar power for their construction activities.

In FY2024, our total energy consumption reached 86,123,274 kWh, with 43 percent sourced from renewable energy. This includes 34,128,360 kWh of green electricity procured through Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) under the Green Electricity Tariff (GET), and an additional 3,010,331 kWh generated from solar energy. As a result, we avoided 25,715 tCO2 e in carbon emissions for FY2024.

For FY2024, we focused on the following renewable energy efforts:

Gamuda aims to purchase **100 percent renewable electricity** on all GEA-managed sites (Western Tunnelling Package, Coffs Harbour, and M1 Motorway), ensuring that our electricity is sourced through certified Green Power. This shift to renewable energy was driven by specific project requirements and bolstered by Gamuda's commitment to sustainability and carbon abatement. By utilising clean energy for these large-scale infrastructure developments, Gamuda continues to lead by example, advancing environmentally responsible practices in the industry.

As the global economy grows and populations increase, the demand for natural resources rises significantly, with the World Resources Institute (WRI) predicting a 40 percent shortfall in water supply by 2030 and a 15 percent increase in global energy demand by 2040. This situation underscores the urgent need for sustainable resource management.

At Gamuda, we understand that if we do not implement robust water management practices, we could face increased operational costs, project delays and potential fines for non-compliance with water regulations. Inadequate water supply can hinder our ability to execute construction projects on time, impacting our reputation and financial performance. Our operations rely heavily on water, electricity, fuel and raw materials and we implement comprehensive strategies to minimise environmental impacts, safeguard resources and lower operational costs. Our approach includes efficient water use, responsible waste management and sustainable material consumption, while also embracing circular economy principles to reduce waste.

We strive to minimise pollution through our business activities by implementing sustainable practices across all our projects. We recognise that construction and engineering can have significant environmental impacts and we are committed to reducing and avoiding these effects.

For example, we utilise dust suppression techniques, such as water spraying and the installation of dust screens, to control airborne particles on our sites. We also optimise our machinery and vehicles for fuel efficiency to reduce emissions and we implement noise reduction measures like sound barriers during construction to minimise disturbance to nearby communities.

Additionally, we prioritise waste management by recycling materials whenever possible and ensuring proper disposal of hazardous waste. Our commitment extends to using environmentally friendly materials and technologies that have lower impacts on air and water quality.

We go beyond regulatory compliance by benchmarking against international environmental standards, as reflected in the attainment of the **ISO 14001:2015 Environmental Management Systems certification in 100 percent of Gamuda's sites**. Our operations remain guided by the Gamuda Green Plan 2025, the UN SDGs and the following Group policies:

- Gamuda Group ESG Policy Statement
- Gamuda Parks Policy and Biodiversity Management Strategies
- Gamuda Quality, Safety and Health, and Environmental Policy

In FY2024, we continued to implement various water conservation initiatives Group-wide, as depicted below:

#### <span id="page-97-0"></span>RESOURCE MANAGEMENT

#### **Water Management and Compliance**

From tendering to contractual obligations, developing and disclosing water management protocols is a requirement. Our practices align with both contract terms and government commitments, integrating these into tailored, project-specific plans to prioritise water stewardship from planning through execution

While Gamuda Berhad has a broader ESG policy, Gamuda Australia tailors this approach through its **Sustainability and Innovation Policy** to ensure regional relevance. Together, these policies foster a culture of responsibility, innovation and environmental stewardship throughout the organisation. By aligning our policies and management approaches across regions, we ensure that sustainability remains at the forefront of our operations globally, meeting and exceeding both local regulations and international best practices.

#### **WATER MANAGEMENT**

Water is a finite natural resource that will be depleted without concerted efforts to protect its sources. We recognise that effective water management is essential for optimising water consumption and ensuring smooth daily operations.

To further strengthen our commitment to sustainable water management, we have completed a water risk assessment using the **Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas**, a science-based tool developed by the WRI. This assessment was essential to understanding potential water risks across our operations. The results confirmed that 100 percent of Gamuda's active operations, sites and premises are not located in water-stressed regions or areas. Additionally, Gamuda actively engages with local communities where our operations are located to address water usage needs, complementing our use of aqueduct systems.

By conducting this risk assessment, we are better equipped to plan and manage our water usage, ensuring that we avoid areas facing water scarcity and that our projects do not contribute to local water challenges. This proactive approach not only mitigates risks but also reinforces our commitment to sustainable development that aligns with natural resources and local ecosystems. Additionally, there were **no reports of non-compliance in FY2022, FY2023 and FY2024**, further demonstrating our adherence to responsible water management.

For FY2024, the total water withdrawal Group-wide was 1,872,475 m3 where 382,206 m3 was surface water and 1,490,269 m3 was third-party withdrawal. The water intensity for Malaysia is calculated at 1,406 L/m². Our strategy takes into account the operational footprint of each site, ensuring that water usage is optimised for both efficiency and sustainability.

#### **Water Consumption Monitoring**

- Next-Gen Digital IBS is monitoring water consumption and its efficiency of water usage by using softwarecontrolled water mix for daily concrete mixing and periodic inspections for underground pipe leakage
- Consumption is recorded monthly through the management platform across the Group, including usage trend analysis
- Any increase in water consumption will be reported to relevant personnel for review and action. This includes recommending the appropriate measures required to lower consumption and minimise wastage

{98}------------------------------------------------

#### **Waste Management Documentation**

- Recorded based on waste type, quantity generated, quantity disposed, collector category and disposal method
- Segregated between hazardous waste and non-hazardous waste
- Tracked monthly via the management platform across the Group, with trend analysis to monitor usage patternsrelevant personnel for review and action. This includes recommending the appropriate measures required to lower consumption and minimise wastage

#### **Reducing Paper Waste**

Utilised a paperless approach in our business activities by leveraging digital tools such as Autodesk Construction Cloud (ACC), SharePoint and email to reduce paper consumption

#### **Waste Storage Facilities**

Designated waste storage areas for hazardous and non-hazardous wastes

#### **Waste Inspections and Audits**

Assessed the effectiveness of waste management through a variety of inspections and audits. This includes scheduled checklists, internal and external audits, as well as software evaluations

#### **Waste Disposal Standards for Contractors**

Required contractors to dispose of their waste at licensed landfills through authorised waste contractors

#### **Sustainable Earthwork Solutions**

- Utilised balanced cut and fill for earthwork activities at project sites
- Reused over 40,000 m³ of contaminated soil across seven locations for the Waurn Ponds Duplication Project through engineered solutions

#### **e-Waste Recycling**

Implemented e-Waste recycling campaign annually and placements of e-Waste bins at designated areas

#### **WASTE MANAGEMENT**

As the global population rises, the demand for housing increases, leading to more construction and greater material usage. This surge makes waste management more critical than ever. Effective waste management is essential to overcoming challenges such as resource depletion and material shortages. At Gamuda, we are dedicated to minimising waste by actively incorporating the principles of the circular economy throughout our operations. Wherever possible, we strive to optimise the use of materials, reduce environmental impact and promote resource efficiency.

#### **MANAGING AND MINIMISING WASTE**

Gamuda Berhad is committed to reducing waste throughout the entire construction process. Our approach to waste management is rooted in the principles of Reduce, Reuse, Repair, Recycle, Rot and Repurpose (6Rs). In line with this commitment, Gamuda has set a target to reduce waste sent to landfill at our development projects by 50 percent by 2030. Additionally, we aim for all our construction sites to reduce construction waste to landfill by 20 percent by 2025. By setting clear objectives and engaging our workforce, we have successfully **diverted 99 percent of construction waste from landfills in Australia**. In our Australian operations, waste is categorised into three main types: hazardous and contaminated waste, clean spoil and construction and demolition waste, and office waste. Hazardous and contaminated waste is handled by licensed specialists for safe removal, isolation,or destruction. Clean spoil and construction and demolition waste are reused on-site when possible or transported to licensed facilities for sorting and processing into new materials. Office waste is managed by municipal waste contractors, with off-site recycling, though on-site segregation remains an essential part of the process.

In FY2024, we continued to advance our initiatives to ensure responsible waste management, going beyond regulatory compliance. All non-hazardous and hazardous waste is handled by government-approved vendors, adhering to strict regulatory standards. We also have implemented additional measures to minimise waste generation and environmental impact by tracking waste transported from our sites to the appropriate waste treatment facilities. The total waste produced in FY2024 is 3,974,271 tonnes, where 188,885 tonnes were non-recyclable waste, 2,807,933 tonnes were hazardous waste, and 974,366 tonnes of waste were recycled. We are proud to report that for the **third consecutive year— FY2022, FY2023, and FY2024 — there have been no instances of non-compliance related to our waste management practices**, reinforcing our commitment to responsible and sustainable operations.

*Note: CIDB - statutory body in Malaysia that plays a crucial role in the development and regulation of the construction industry.*

#### **Mitigating Water Quality Risks Through Enhanced WTP Standards**

Treatment Specialist Gradient, designed and commissioned the Rosehill Water Treatment Plant to meet the water demands for Herrenknecht's tunnel boring machines (TBMs). Historically, tunnelling in Australia relied on potable water, but the project adopted the use of treated groundwater and rainwater as a key strategy from the early planning phase. This water is not only used for TBM operations but is also reclaimed for other purposes, further enhancing sustainability. The initiative aims to replace **50.7 percent** of potable water use, with over **440 ML** expected to be utilised during construction. As of September 2024, approximately **168 ML**, or **39 percent** of the project's total water usage, has come from non-potable sources, a figure expected to increase with ongoing TBM operations. This innovative water management approach has already saved over 160 ML of potable water, setting a new sustainability benchmark for tunnelling projects. The plant's treatment process ensures compliance with both TBM operational needs and NSW Environmental Protection Authority (EPA) water quality discharge specifications.

**Enhancing Resource Efficiency and Sustainability through Gamuda's Next Generation Industrialised Building Systems: A Life Cycle Analysis** 

The Gamuda Green Plan aims for a **40 percent reduction in carbon emissions** across developments and townships by 2030. This initiative is driven by **Gamuda's Next-Gen Digital IBS (NGDIBS)** and **Green Building design** principles. The effectiveness of this approach is exemplified in the upcoming housing project, **Gamuda Gardens Valeria Phase 5A (GG5A)**, which features 270 linked houses constructed with **98 percent pre-cast IBS elements**.

To evaluate the benefits of Gamuda's sustainable homes strategy, a comprehensive Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) was conducted on GG5A, benchmarking it against the conventional brickwork construction method. The study revealed significant emission reductions during both the product and construction stages, underscoring the advantages of utilising sustainable building materials and efficient resource consumption.

#### **Key Findings:**

- **Reduced Product Stage Emissions by 41 percent:** This reduction is achieved through the precise manufacturing of pre-cast concrete elements under controlled conditions with Gamuda's Next-Gen Digital IBS and the incorporation of sustainable materials, including supplementary cementitious material (SCM) in concrete and recycled steel
- **Reduced Construction Stage Emissions by 53 percent:** This decrease is attributed to lower energy consumption resulting from a higher volume of pre-cast elements which optimises machinery usage at the site compared to conventional brickwork methods
- **Reduced Upfront Embodied Emissions (Product Stage + Construction Stage) by 43 percent:** This outcome is achieved through a combination of selecting sustainable building materials with lower embodied carbon and efficient material utilisation, leading to optimised resource consumption

The LCA also highlighted the environmental advantages of Gamuda's Next-Gen Digital IBS over the conventional brickwork construction method. The systematic prefabrication of IBS elements significantly minimises material waste, achieving a **waste reduction of up to 90 percent on-site**. Additionally, IBS contributes to lower resource consumption during the construction and installation process, resulting in **electricity savings of 27 percent, fuel savings of 51 percent** and **water savings of 55 percent**. This translates into reduced project costs and a smaller environmental footprint, reinforcing Gamuda's commitment to sustainable development.

#### **MATERIAL EFFICIENCY AND RESPONSIBLE SOURCING**

In FY2024, we consumed 887 tonnes of renewable and 276,511 tonnes of non-renewable materials for the Western Tunneling Project (WTP), which mainly consist of concrete, steel and timber.

#### **Material Consumption Review**

- Established standardised procedures for data collection and reporting

#### **Resource Allocation and Use Targets**

- Allocated financial resources for purchasing materials and ensured designated personnel for weighing system reporting
- Ensured raw materials and concrete are inspected for their quality by the QC teams
- Aligned our resource usage with the Group's directive on time-specific targets. The progress is monitored in accordance with specific project durations

#### **Supplier Collaboration**

- Facilitated accurate material reporting through transparent communication on WhatsApp
- Required delivery orders for each shipment
- Implemented a weighing system at the concrete plant for verifying material quantities

#### **Standardisation Measures**

Additionally, we have adopted Building Information Modelling (BIM) technology to minimise waste during the design phase and use prefabricated and modular construction techniques to lower material-related emissions. For the Coffs Harbour Bypass Project, we have developed an on-site batching plant that minimise transport distances and in turn, reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This overview highlights our material management practices, reflecting our commitment to responsible sourcing, efficient resource allocation and transparent data management across all projects.

- Utilised a standardised weighing system to ensure consistency in the measurements of materials across sites. This includes adhering to a Project Quality Plan (PQP) with an inspection test plan
- *Total weight or volume of materials that are used to produce and package products and services (tonnes) were subject to an external limited assurance by an independent 3rd party. Refer to the independent assurance report on pages 233 to 237.*

Gamuda Australia is leading advancements in sustainable construction, particularly through the development of low-carbon alternatives for concrete. The WTP precast concrete segment mix has set a significant industry milestone. This innovative mix incorporates 50 percent Supplementary Cementitious Materials (SCM) and a 50 percent replacement of natural sand with recycled sand, substantially reducing its environmental impact. This shift has led to an abatement of approximately 12,000 tCO2 e.

This innovation reduces cement consumption, further lowering the carbon footprint of the construction process. This new standard highlights the potential of sustainable materials in reducing the carbon intensity of large-scale infrastructure projects while supporting the circular economy through the use of recycled materials. Gamuda's approach is not only a leap forward in green construction but also a critical step towards meeting global sustainability targets.

{100}------------------------------------------------

Healthy ecosystems help regulate the climate, purify water and provide the raw materials essential to many industries, including construction. The United Nations highlights that biodiversity contributes to over half of global GDP, yet it is under threat. Human activities are driving species extinction rates to be tens to hundreds of times higher than the natural baseline, with nearly one million species at risk according to the UN. This highlights a growing challenge for businesses: the need to balance development with the preservation of the ecosystems that sustain both nature and economies.

#### **GAMUDA'S COMMITMENT TO BIODIVERSITY**

- Direct connection between biodiversity and our projects
- Opportunities to mitigate environmental impacts and enhance local ecosystems

#### **TNFD ADOPTER**

In FY2024, Gamuda became the only engineering and construction company in Malaysia to adopt the TNFD. We are actively preparing for TNFD reporting, addressing nature-related dependencies, impacts, risks and opportunities as we understand the need to treat biodiversity loss with the same urgency as climate change. Our proactive approach keeps us ahead of regulatory demands while contributing to global efforts in biodiversity conservation.

![](_page_100_Picture_23.jpeg)

#### **National Policy on Biological Diversity (NPBD) 2022-2030**

Our efforts are guided by the Gamuda Green Plan 2025 and the Malaysia's NPBD. We prioritise Goals 1, 2, 3 and 5 of this policy, which align with

our objectives for biodiversity conservation.

The NPBD embodies the spirit of the SDGs and aligns with the key elements of the Kunming-Montreal GBF, which Malaysia adopted during the 15th Conference of the Parties (COP15) at the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) in Kunming, China. Gamuda has actively participated in the working group to develop a "Strategic Roadmap" and "Business Biodiversity Action Plan" as part of the NPBD to implement business-related targets of the KMGBF at the national level.

#### **Going Beyond Compliance**

Gamuda consistently exceeds regulatory expectations; for instance, we increase the required 10 percent green space in developments to 11 percent or 12 percent, demonstrating our proactive approach to environmental responsibility. We recognise that integrating biodiversity considerations into all phases of our projects—from initial planning to final execution—goes beyond mere compliance. It reflects a strategic commitment to sustainable development and environmental stewardship. By embedding biodiversity into our core operations, we actively contribute to the preservation, regeneration and enhancement of local ecosystems, fostering long-term ecological resilience and delivering value not only to our stakeholders but to the environment as well.

#### **Biodiversity Management Plan (BMP) Coffs Harbour**

On the Coffs Harbour bypass project in Coffs Harbour, New South Wales, Australia, our Biodiversity Management Plan (BMP) is designed to address potential biodiversity impacts throughout detailed design, pre-construction and construction phases. The plan includes comprehensive management and mitigation measures to ensure compliance with key environmental guidelines.

To safeguard the environment from the start, we implemented an Environmental Work Method System (EWMS) to manage high-risk activities. These include operations near sensitive areas such as waterways, temporary crossings, site setup, stockpiles, clearing zones, sediment basins, dewatering sites and blasting areas. High-risk activities require additional oversight and approval, with consultations involving relevant stakeholders and authorities.

#### **M1 Pacific Motorway Extension to Raymond Terrace Project: Black Hill to Tomago**

A joint venture between John Holland and Gamuda is delivering the 10-kilometre southern section of the M1 Pacific Motorway extension from Black Hill to Tomago, New South Wales, Australia. This project fills a crucial national motorway gap between Sydney and Brisbane, aiming to reduce up to 25,000 vehicles per day from key congestion points. The extension will enhance connectivity, efficiency and safety for interstate motorists while alleviating congestion and lowering traffic volumes for local commuters.

For this project, we undertook several biodiversity conservation related measures:

In August 2023, we implemented biodiversity management measures along the project corridor and carried out pre-clearing surveys to ensure minimal impacts on flora and fauna wherever possible. This involved developing a Construction Environmental Management Plan (CEMP) to outline the ways we preserve, protect and manage any potential impacts on the local environment prior to commencing any

In November 2023, our Environmental Team collaborated with ecologists to oversee the creation of tree replacement hollows before the project's northern section's clearing. These hollows were designed to shelter native fauna potentially displaced during construction and the

Launched in May 2024 in celebration of the International Day for Biological Diversity, the park prioritises pollination and habitat support. It includes native trees cultivated at our ATP nurseries with a central fountain and a diverse array of plants and flowers.

#### **#Generation Restoration**

Gamuda Australia's graduates partnered with Deerubbin Local Aboriginal Land Council to regenerate flora and fauna at Agnes Banks bushlands in Western Sydney as part of the graduate programmes Social Impact project. The graduates designed and built 30 habitat prototypes and planted 400 native seedlings to attract local wildlife. This project supports Gamuda Australia's Reconciliation Action Plan, Seeds of Growth sustainability framework, and is in alignment with the #GenerationRestoration initiative.

#### **Education and Awareness**

The Gamuda Parks Urban Ecology Biodiversity (GUEB) Programme successfully conducted a series of 11 training modules aimed at enhancing employees' knowledge of biodiversity. Attended by 304 participants, the sessions covered topics such as biodiversity awareness, sustainable plant care, small-scale composting, and traditional dyeing techniques. Additional areas included urban wildlife conflicts, botany and landscape management, water quality management, plant species challenges, tree risk management and wetlands exploration. Participants provided positive feedback and future plans will focus on expanding the programme with more technical content and field visits.

#### **Creating Awareness Among the Local Communities**

We engaged with diverse communities through various events and activities focused on wetlands, biodiversity and environmental awareness. Collaborations included community service students organising activities with the *Orang Asli* community and partnering with a private educational institution for biophilia talks. Our school roadshow series fostered nature enthusiasm among primary students while a nature eco trail fun run combined biodiversity education with physical activity. Additionally, partnerships with the Malaysia Nature Society for World Otter Day and World Environment Day raised awareness about biodiversity and human-nature conflicts. These initiatives reached over 15,700 individuals.

#### **Tree Planting Programme**

Tree planting is a key initiative in our broader environmental sustainability strategy. Our tree planting programmes are integrated across multiple project sites, particularly in urban developments and infrastructure projects, ensuring that green corridors and biodiversity are maintained.

We collaborate with local communities, environmental organisations and governmental bodies to carry out these initiatives. With a commitment to planting native species, we aim to preserve local ecosystems, support wildlife habitats and promote long-term environmental stewardship. By strategically planting trees, we also work to avoid urban heat islands, enhancing the urban environment. Each tree planted represents our dedication to creating a greener future for generations to come.

As part of the OneMillionTrees Movement, we have planted and nurtured 750,178 trees. This initiative is supported by our Advanced Tree Planting (ATP) nurseries, which utilise the Miyawaki method at various locations, including Gamuda Cove, Gamuda Gardens, twentyfive7 and Jade Hills. To ensure we are restoring environments closer to their original state, our target is for at least 50 percent of the planted trees to be of native origin. Currently, 72 percent of the trees in the ATP nurseries are native species, and 27 percent are recognised for their conservation importance. We aim to reach our goal of one million trees planted by 2030.

#### *Note:*

*Conservation importance - Species that play a critical role in maintaining the health and balance of ecosystems.* 

*Native species - Species that have adapted to the specific environmental conditions of a given area.*

#### **Biodiversity Audits**

We comply with regulatory requirements and go beyond the necessary environmental impact assessments (EIA) by conducting biodiversity and carbon stock assessments, particularly in areas near nature reserves. As part of going beyond these requirements, these assessments are carried out prior to the start of each project to gain a robust understanding of the natural ecosystems and to develop a biodiversity conservation plan before any development occurs.

As of FY2024, we have completed 13 biodiversity audits in Malaysia and Vietnam. These audits are comprehensive evaluations of our projects' impact on biodiversity and include a detailed analysis of compliance with conservation goals. Our most recent audit, conducted in collaboration with a local university and involving botanists and horticulturists, assessed plant species diversity and included a survey of animal species and habitat analysis, identifying rare and endangered species. The survey utilised line transect methods to cover insects, fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds and small mammals. Based on the findings, we developed strategies to enhance biodiversity and improve habitats.

The Group recognises the critical importance of addressing climate change and is committed to reducing emissions in the short, medium, and long term. To support this commitment, the Group has implemented climate-related governance and strategies across its operations, ensuring that climate-related risks and opportunities are integrated at all levels of the organisation. In FY2024, Gamuda expanded its emissions tracking to 10 most material sources of Scope 3 emission.

Since FY2021, the Group has aligned with the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) framework. We officially expressed our support for TCFD in FY2022 and have since improved and implemented its principles to continuously monitor our performance and progress. Gamuda's approach reflects the four TCFD pillars: Governance, Strategy, Risk Management, and Metrics and Targets, with relevant details and disclosures available in the ESG Impact Report 2024.

In FY2024, we further strengthened our commitment to climate-related initiatives by continuing to collect Scope 3 emissions data from our suppliers. We are also assessing our carbon stocks to determine our carbon life cycle as part of our preparation for future carbon credits/tax. Adopting the TCFD framework underscores the Group's dedication to continuously monitoring its performance in alignment with globally recognised standards for addressing climate change.

Looking ahead, we will transition to ISSB IFRS S2 (International Sustainability Standards Board International Financial Reporting Standards Sustainability Disclosure Standards 2) in place of TCFD disclosures in our upcoming reports.

Gamuda has aligned with the four TCFD themes: Governance, Strategy, Risk Management, and Metrics and Targets. The table below provides a concise, detailed explanation of how Gamuda has adopted specific TCFD topics and recommended disclosures. Where relevant, references are provided to more specific information within the ESG Impact Report 2024.

Essentially, Gamuda's management approach to climate change-related impacts focuses on the following:

- Leadership, including the Board of Directors (Board) oversight on climate change through the Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) mechanism
- The strategic consideration given to climate change is reflected in the development of policies and strategies
- A continued focus on embedding climate change within the Group's risk management and mitigation framework
- The existence of tangible, time-based key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure performance

| Describe the<br>impact of climate<br>related risks and<br>opportunities on<br>the organisation's<br>businesses, strategy,<br>and financial<br>planning. | We recognise that climate-related risks—such as extreme weather, resource scarcity, and supply<br>chain disruptions—directly impact our operations. For example, increased severe weather can cause<br>production delays and infrastructure damage. Conversely, embracing opportunities like energy<br>efficiency and renewable energy, reduces our carbon footprint and leads to cost savings and greater<br>operational resilience, as seen in our renewable energy implementations.<br>As climate regulations tighten, we must allocate resources for compliance, which affects our<br>financial planning and capital allocation. For instance, Bursa Malaysia now mandates climate<br>related disclosures. To manage risks in our projects, we are investing in infrastructure resilience and<br>emissions-reduction technologies, which impact our overall budget.<br>In projects like the WTP, Coff Harbour, and M1 in Australia, we are committed to using 100 percent<br>green energy. This approach significantly reduces our carbon emissions and aligns with our strategy<br>to minimise environmental impact. Prioritising green energy not only mitigates regulatory risks but<br>also enhances our reputation and creates new growth opportunities.<br>For further details on Gamuda's climate risk and opportunity related to financials, refer to page 123.                                                                                                                                                                                       | Page 118<br>Gamuda Green Plan<br>2025<br>Pages 180 - 181<br>Our Net Zero<br>Journey<br>Page 123<br>Climate Risk<br>and Opportunity:<br>In Alignment<br>to International<br>Financial Reporting<br>Standards (IFRS S2)<br>Pages 178 - 211<br>Value to the<br>Environment |

Risk Identification: Gamuda employs a comprehensive risk identification framework to pinpoint potential climate-related risks that could impact our operations. This includes direct risks, such as extreme weather events (e.g., flooding in Malaysia, hurricanes in Taiwan), and indirect risks, such as regulatory shifts, supply chain vulnerabilities, and reputational risks tied to our carbon emissions. Our assessments utilise quantitative methodologies to evaluate risks throughout the construction life cycle, ensuring that both immediate and long-term risks and opportunities are captured, extending to the operational phase post-construction.

Data Collection and Analysis: We leverage advanced data analytics and predictive modelling techniques to collect and analyse climate-related data, enabling us to understand historical impacts on our business and the broader industry. This data encompasses historical weather patterns, regulatory frameworks, and the operational experiences of peer organisations.

Scenario Analysis: To evaluate future risks, we employ scenario analysis using sophisticated climate modelling tools that simulate various climate scenarios, including different temperature rise trajectories and their associated socio-economic impacts. We assess how these scenarios could influence our business model, taking into account both physical risks—such as infrastructure vulnerability to extreme weather and transition risks, including evolving regulations and market dynamics. Our analysis includes detailed hydrological assessments for flood risk (50 & 100 Annual Return Intervals) and sea level rise projections, informing our design strategies and leading to adaptive measures, such as elevating structures to mitigate

Stakeholder Engagement: We actively engage a diverse array of stakeholders, including customers, suppliers, local communities, and industry experts, utilising structured dialogues and workshops to gather insights on their concerns and expectations regarding climate-related risks. This stakeholder feedback is integrated into our risk management framework, enhancing our resilience strategy and ensuring alignment

#### Risk Prioritisation: We start by identifying and assessing the potential risks. Once that is done, we will prioritise them based on their significance and potential impact on our organisation or project. This prioritisation guides our risk mitigation efforts.

Mitigation and Adaptation Strategies: We develop and implement strategies to mitigate identified risks together with adapting to changing climate conditions. These strategies are tailored to the specific nature of each risk. They encompass areas like infrastructure resilience, diversification of suppliers, and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.

Monitoring and Reporting: We regularly oversee and, when necessary, revise our risk assessments to incorporate new data together with insights. Moreover, we provide transparent reports on our climaterelated risks and our advancements in addressing them. To facilitate this, we have implemented a cloud-based, organisation-wide data collection system that can display real-time emissions data through a user-friendly dashboard (this platform covers projects too).

#### *Disclosure:*

*In our previous reporting, we inadvertently omitted an important clarification regarding the treatment of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for locations that did not exist during the baseline year. To ensure a fair comparison of GHG emission reductions over time, the emissions for these newly established locations have been retroactively added to the baseline year.*

*This adjustment is consistent with the GHG Protocol's policy of "shifting" or "rolling" the base year. By including the emissions from newly established facilities or locations within the updated boundaries, we ensure that reductions are measured accurately and reflect any expansions in operational scope. This correction ensures transparency and alignment with best practices in GHG accounting and reporting.*

The absence of a significant body of established practice on which to draw to evaluate and measure the Subject Matter Information allows for different, but acceptable, measurement basis and can affect comparability between entities and over time. In addition, Greenhouse Gas ("GHG") quantification is subject to inherent uncertainty because of incomplete scientific knowledge used to determine emissions factors and the values needed to combine emissions of different gases.

The uncertainties and limitations are laid out in more detail in the Reporting Criteria.

#### **OUR RESPONSIBILITY**

Our responsibility is to express a limited assurance conclusion on the Subject Matter Information based on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have obtained. We conducted our limited assurance engagement in accordance with the approved standard for assurance engagements in Malaysia, ISAE 3000 (Revised) "Assurance Engagements Other Than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information". This standard requires that we plan and perform this engagement under consideration of materiality to express our conclusion with limited assurance about whether the Subject Matter Information is free from material misstatement.

#### **OUR INDEPENDENCE AND QUALITY MANAGEMENT**

We have complied with the independence and other ethical requirements of the By-Laws (on Professional Ethics, Conduct and Practice) of the Malaysian Institute of Accountants ("MIA") and the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants' International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including International Independence Standards), which is founded on fundamental principles of integrity, objectivity, professional competence and due care, confidentiality and professional behaviour.

The firm applies International Standard on Quality Management 1, which requires the firm to design, implement and operate a system of quality management including policies or procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.

#### **SUMMARY OF WORK PERFORMED**

Our work included the following procedures. We:

● Evaluated the suitability in the circumstances of the Company's Reporting Criteria as the basis for preparing the Subject Matter Information; ● Obtained an understanding of the Company's control environment, processes and systems relevant to the preparation of the Subject Matter Information at the consolidated level and operating unit level. Our procedures did not include evaluating the suitability of design or operating

● Evaluated the appropriateness of measurement and evaluation methods, reporting policies used and estimates made by the Company, noting that our procedures did not involve testing the data on which the estimates are based or separately developing our own estimates

- 
- effectiveness of control activities;
- against which to evaluate the Company's estimates;
- Performed review analytics on the Subject Matter Information;
- recorded, collated and reported;
- Travels) emissions are obtained from reputable sources, where relevant;
- Criteria; and
- 

● Performed limited substantive testing on a sampling basis on transactions included in the Subject Matter Information which involved agreeing data points to/from source information to check that the underlying subject matter had been appropriately evaluated or measured,

● Assessed whether the emission/conversion factors used in the calculation of the Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 (Category 6 - Business

● Checked mathematical formulas, proxies and default values used in the Subject Matter Information against the Company's Reporting

● Evaluated the appropriateness of the disclosures and presentation of the Subject Matter Information based on the Reporting Criteria.

The procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing from, and are less in extent than for, a reasonable assurance engagement. Consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had we performed a reasonable assurance engagement. Accordingly, we do not express a reasonable assurance opinion about whether the Subject Matter Information has been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Reporting Criteria.

#### **RESTRICTION ON DISTRIBUTION AND USE AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY TO THIRD PARTIES AND FOR ANY OTHER PURPOSE**

Our report, including our conclusion, has been prepared solely for the Board of Directors of the Company in accordance with the agreements between us dated 16 July 2024 and 16 October 2024. We consent to the inclusion of this report in the ESG Impact Report 2024 which will be accessible from the website of the Company at www.gamuda.com.my in connection with the Company's responsibilities under paragraph 6.2(e) of Practice Note 9 of the Main Market Listing Requirements in respect of the disclosure of a statement on whether the listed issuer has sought independent assurance on the Subject Matter Information. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility or liability to anyone other than the Company for our work or this report except where terms are expressly agreed between us in writing. Any reliance on this report by any third party is entirely at its own risk.

# **INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT**

To the members of Gamuda Berhad Registration No. 197601003632 (29579-T) (Incorporated in Malaysia)

#### **REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

#### **Opinion**

We have audited the financial statements of Gamuda Berhad, which comprise the statements of financial position as at 31 July 2024 of the Group and of the Company, and the income statements, statements of other comprehensive income, statements of changes in equity and statements of cash flows of the Group and of the Company for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including material accounting policy information, as set out on pages 256 to 427.

In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Group and of the Company as at 31 July 2024, and of their financial performance and their cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Malaysian Financial Reporting Standards, International Financial Reporting Standards and the requirements of the Companies Act 2016 in Malaysia.

#### **Basis For Opinion**

We conducted our audit in accordance with approved standards on auditing in Malaysia and International Standards on Auditing. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the *Auditors' responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements* section of our report. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.

#### **Independence and Other Ethical Responsibilities**

We are independent of the Group and of the Company in accordance with the By-Laws (on Professional Ethics, Conduct and Practice) of the Malaysian Institute of Accountants ("By-Laws") and the International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including International Independence Standards) ("IESBA Code"), and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the By-Laws and the IESBA Code.

#### **Key Audit Matters**

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company for the current year. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. For each matter below, our description of how our audit addressed the matter is provided in that context.

We have fulfilled the responsibilities described in the *Auditors' responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements* section of our report, including in relation to these matters. Accordingly, our audit included the performance of procedures designed to respond to our assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements. The results of our audit procedures, including the procedures performed to address the matters below, provide the basis of our audit opinion on the accompanying financial statements.

#### **1. Revenue and construction contract costs recognised as contract expenses**

76% and 97% of the Group's and of the Company's revenues respectively are derived from construction contracts which span more than one accounting period. For the financial year ended 31 July 2024, contract revenue and construction contract costs recognised as contract expenses are as follows:

Group's and Company's construction contracts • Revenue: RM10,202,704,000 and RM4,473,318,000 respectively • Construction contract costs recognised as contract expenses: RM9,310,708,000 and RM4,221,178,000 respectively

- 
- 

The Group and Company have determined that certain performance obligations in relation to construction activities are satisfied over time and thus recognised revenue from these activities over time.

We identified construction contract revenue and construction contract costs recognised as contract expenses as areas requiring special audit consideration as these areas involved significant management's judgement and estimates. In particular, we focused on the following areas:

i. Judgement and estimates made in the determination of whether variations in contract works should be included in the contract

ii. Estimates made in respect of the total estimated contract costs (which forms part of the computation of percentage-of-completion

- revenue; and
- for the construction contracts).

To the members of Gamuda Berhad Registration No. 197601003632 (29579-T) (Incorporated in Malaysia)

#### **REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONT'D.)**

#### **Key Audit Matters (cont'd.)**

#### **1. Revenue and construction contract costs recognised as contract expenses (cont'd.)**

In addressing this area of focus, we performed, amongst others, the following procedures:

- i. Read the contract to obtain an understanding of the specific terms and conditions;
- ii. Obtained an understanding of the relevant processes and internal controls over the accuracy and timing of revenue recognised in the financial statements, including controls performed by the management in estimating variation orders, claims, total contract costs, profit margin and progress of construction projects;
- iii. Observed the progress of the constructions on a sampling basis by performing site visits and examined the physical completion progress reports. We have also discussed the status of ongoing constructions with management, finance personnel and project officials;
- iv. Evaluated management's assessment on whether provision for liquidated ascertained damages is required through supporting documents such as the construction agreements for the rates, extension of time approvals and work progress report indicating the reasons for the delay and efforts to catch up for phases whereby actual progress is behind planned progress;
- v. Agreed the contract sum to approved variation order forms with respect to variations in contract works and claims for costs not included in the contract price; and
- vi. Evaluated the assumptions applied in the determination of the progress of construction projects in light of supporting evidence such as letters of award, approved purchase orders, sub-contractors' claims and invoices on a sampling basis.

The Group's and the Company's disclosure on contract assets and liabilities is included in Note 22 to the financial statements.

#### **2. Revenue and land and development costs**

19% of the Group's revenues are derived from property development contracts which span more than one accounting period. For the financial year ended 31 July 2024, property development revenue and land and development costs are as follows:

#### Property development activities

- Revenue: RM2,596,213,000
- Land and development costs: RM1,897,806,000

The Group has determined that certain performance obligations in relation to property development activities are satisfied over time and thus recognises revenue from these activities over time.

The amount of revenue and profit recognised from property development activities are dependent on, amongst others, the extent of costs incurred to the total estimated costs of construction to derive the percentage-of-completion; the actual number of units sold and the estimated total revenue for each of the respective projects.

We identified revenue and land and development costs from property development activities as areas requiring audit focus as significant management's judgement and estimates are involved in estimating the total property development costs which include the common infrastructure costs (which is used to determine gross profit margin of property development activities undertaken by the Group).

In addressing this area of focus, we performed, amongst others, the following procedures:

- i. Obtained an understanding of the processes and internal controls over the accuracy and timing of revenue recognised in the financial statements, including controls performed by management in estimating the total property development cost, profit margin and progress of development projects;
- ii. We read the sales and purchase agreements entered into with customers on a sampling basis to obtain an understanding of the specific terms and conditions;

#### **REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONT'D.)**

#### **Key Audit Matters (cont'd.)**

#### **2. Revenue and land and development costs (cont'd.)**

In addressing this area of focus, we performed, amongst others, the following procedures (cont'd.):

iii. Evaluated assumptions applied in estimating the total property development costs on a sampling basis for each property development phase by examining documentary evidence such as letters of award issued to contractors to support the budgeted gross development cost. We also considered the historical accuracy of management's forecasts for the similar property development projects within the Group in evaluating the estimated total property development costs;

iv. Observed the progress of the property development phases on a sampling basis by performing site visits and examined the physical completion progress reports. We have also discussed the status of ongoing property development phases with management,

v. Evaluated management's assessment on whether provision for liquidated ascertained damages is required through supporting documents such as the sales and purchase agreements for the rates, extension of time approvals and work progress report indicating the reasons for the delay and efforts to catch up for phases whereby actual progress is behind planned progress; and

- 
- finance personnel and project officials;
- 
- as contractors' progress claims and suppliers' invoices.

vi. Evaluated the determination of progress of development projects by examining the supporting evidence on a sampling basis such

The Group's disclosure on property development costs recognised is included in Note 13(b) to the financial statements.

#### **3. Impairment of property, plant and equipment ("PPE") in a subsidiary, Gamuda Industrial Building System Sdn. Bhd. ("GIBS")**

The carrying amount of GIBS's PPE as at 31 July 2024 is RM298,515,000.

GIBS is involved in the manufacturing and installation of prefabricated concrete panels for construction of buildings. The cashgenerating unit ("CGU") of the manufacturing and installation of prefabricated concrete panels has recorded continued losses. This gives rise to impairment indicators for the carrying amounts of the PPE of the CGUs. Accordingly, the Group had performed an impairment assessment on the assets in the subsidiary by estimating the recoverable amount applying the value-in-use ("VIU") method. Estimating the VIU involves estimating the future cash inflows and outflows that will be derived from the cash generating unit, and discounting them at an appropriate rate.

Due to the significance of the amount and the subjectivity involved in estimating the VIU, we identified this as our area of audit focus as the impairment assessment involves determining the recoverable amounts using a discounted cash flow approach which is complex and highly judgemental. Significant assumptions applied in the discounted cash flow, including revenue growth rate is affected by the local market demand for the subsidiary's products, and the economic conditions surrounding the property development sector. Judgement was also applied in determining the appropriate rate to discount the future cash flows to its present value.

In addressing this area of focus, we performed, amongst others, the following procedures:

- 
- 

i. Obtained an understanding of the relevant processes and internal controls over estimating the recoverable amount of the PPE;

ii. Evaluated the management's assumptions on revenue growth rate, gross profit margin and utilisation rate against the Group's plan to supply the prefabricated concrete panels for use in the Group's future development projects;

**3. Impairment of property, plant and equipment ("PPE") in a subsidiary, Gamuda Industrial Building System Sdn. Bhd. ("GIBS") (cont'd.)**

In addressing this area of focus, we performed, amongst others, the following procedures: (cont'd.)

- iii. Assessed the appropriateness of the discount rate used to determine the present value of the cash flows and whether the rate used reflects the current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset is the return that investors would require if they were to choose an investment that would generate cash flows of amounts, timing and risk profile equivalent to those that the entity expects to derive from the asset; and
- iv. Analysed the sensitivity of the key assumptions by assessing the impact of changes to the key assumptions on the recoverable amount.

The Group's disclosure on impairment assessment of PPE in GIBS is included in Note 12(a) to the financial statements.

#### **4. Impairment of investment in a subsidiary - GIBS**

The carrying amount of the Company's investment in the wholly-owned subsidiary - GIBS as at 31 July 2024 is RM409,500,000 which accounted for approximately 3% of the Company's total assets.

The continued losses reported by the Company's subsidiary, GIBS, indicated that the carrying amount of the investment in subsidiary may be impaired. Accordingly, the Company had performed an impairment assessment on the investment in the subsidiary by estimating the recoverable amount applying the value-in-use ("VIU") method. Estimating the VIU involves estimating the future cash inflows and outflows that will be derived from the cash generating unit, and discounting them at an appropriate rate.

Due to the significance of the amount and the subjectivity involved in estimating the VIU, we identified this as our area of audit focus as the impairment assessment involves determining the recoverable amounts using a discounted cash flow approach which is complex and highly judgmental. Significant assumptions applied in the discounted cash flow, including revenue growth rate is affected by the local market demand for the subsidiary's products, and the economic conditions surrounding the property development sector. Judgement was also applied in determining the appropriate rate to discount the future cash flows to its present value.

In addressing this area of focus, we performed, amongst others, the following procedures:

- i. Obtained an understanding of the relevant processes and internal controls over estimating the recoverable amount of the investment in the subsidiary;
- ii. Evaluated the management's assumptions on revenue growth rate, gross profit margin and utilisation rate against the Group's plan to supply the prefabricated concrete panels for use in the Group's future development projects;
- iii. Assessed the appropriateness of the discount rate used to determine the present value of the cash flows and whether the rate used reflects the return that investors would require if they were to choose an investment that would generate cash flows of amounts, timing and risk profile equivalent to those that the entity expects to derive; and
- iv. Analysed the sensitivity of the key assumptions by assessing the impact of changes to the key assumptions on the recoverable amount.

The Company's disclosure on impairment assessment of investment in GIBS are included in Note 17(c) to the financial statements.

#### **5. Impairment assessment of goodwill in DT Infrastructure Pty Ltd ("DTI")**

As disclosed in Note 17(b)(i) of the financial statements, the Group has completed the acquisition of Downer Transport Projects business via a wholly owned foreign subsidiary, DTI for a total consideration of RM712,223,000. As a result, the Group recognised goodwill amounting to RM522,416,000 upon acquisition.

As required by MFRS 136 Impairment of Assets, an impairment review is performed on goodwill at least annually and when there is an indicator of impairment. In carrying out the impairment assessment of goodwill, management determined the recoverable amount based on the VIU calculation of the CGU.

Due to the significance of the amount and the subjectivity involved in estimating the VIU, we identified this as our area of audit focus as the impairment assessment involves determining the recoverable amounts using a discounted cash flow approach which is complex and highly judgmental. Significant assumptions applied in the discounted cash flow, includes revenue growth rate, which is affected by the ability to secure future projects. Judgement was also applied in determining the appropriate rate to discount the future cash flows to its present value.

Our procedures to address this area of audit focus include, amongst others, the following:

i. Obtained an understanding of the relevant internal controls over estimating the recoverable amount of the CGU;

iii. Assessed and tested the reasonableness of the key assumptions to which the recoverable amount of the CGUs are most sensitive such as estimated contract values, conversion rates and budgeted gross margin by comparing them to internal historical data;

- 
- ii. Assessed the allocation of goodwill to CGU;
- 
- 
- amount of CGU.

iv. Involved our internal specialists to assess the appropriateness of the discount rates and terminal growth rates applied; and

v. Analysed the sensitivity of the key assumptions by assessing the impact of changes to the key assumptions on the recoverable

We have also focused on the adequacy of the Group's disclosures in the audited financial statements concerning the key assumptions. The disclosure on goodwill, key assumptions and sensitivities of these assumptions are included in Note 16(c) to the financial statements.

We have fulfilled the responsibilities described in the *Auditors' responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements* section of our report, including in relation to these matters. Accordingly, our audit included the performance of procedures designed to respond to our assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements. The results of our audit procedures, including the procedures performed to address the matters below, provide the basis of our audit opinion on the accompanying financial statements.

#### **Information Other than the Financial Statements and Auditor's Report**

The directors of the Company are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the Directors' Report, but does not include the financial statements of the Group and of the Company and our auditors' report thereon, which we obtained prior to the date of this auditors' report, and the information included in the annual report, which is expected to be made available to us after the date of this auditors' report.

Our opinion on the financial statements of the Group and of the Company does not cover the other information and we do not express any

form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, our responsibility is to read the other information identified above and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements of the Group and of the Company or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

When we read the annual report, if we conclude that there is a material misstatement therein, we are required to communicate the matter to the directors of the Company and take appropriate action.

#### **REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONT'D.)**

#### **Responsibilities of Directors for the Financial Statements**

The directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation of financial statements of the Group and of the Company that give a true and fair view in accordance with Malaysian Financial Reporting Standards, International Financial Reporting Standards and the requirements of the Companies Act 2016 in Malaysia. The directors are also responsible for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements of the Group and of the Company that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, the directors are responsible for assessing the Group's and the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

#### **Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements**

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements of the Group and of the Company as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors' report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with approved standards on auditing in Malaysia and International Standards on Auditing will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with approved standards on auditing in Malaysia and International Standards on Auditing, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:

- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's and the Company's internal control.
- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the directors.
- Conclude on the appropriateness of the directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's or the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditors' report to the related disclosures in the financial statements of the Group and of the Company or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors' report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group or the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.
- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements of the Group and of the Company represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
- Plan and perform the group audit to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business units within the group as a basis for forming an opinion on the financial statements of the Group. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and review of the audit work performed for purposes of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

#### **REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONT'D.)**

#### **Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements (cont'd.)**

We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied.

From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current year and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditors' report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

#### **REPORT ON OTHER LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS**

In accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2016 in Malaysia, we report that the subsidiaries of which we have not acted as auditors, are disclosed in Note 17(d) to the financial statements.

#### **OTHER MATTERS**

This report is made solely to the members of the Company, as a body, in accordance with Section 266 of the Companies Act 2016 in Malaysia and for no other purpose. We do not assume responsibility to any other person for the content of this report.

# <span id="page-139-0"></span>**NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

- 31 July 2024

#### **2. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (CONT'D.)**

**2.2 Changes in accounting policies (cont'd.)**

The adoption of these amended standards did not have any material financial impact to the Group and the Company, except for:

#### **Amendments to MFRS 101 and MFRS Practice Statement 2**

The amendments to MFRS 101 and MFRS Practice Statement 2 provide guidance and examples to help entities apply materiality judgements to accounting policy disclosures. The amendments aim to help entities provide accounting policy disclosures that are more useful by replacing the requirement for entities to disclose their "significant" accounting policies with a requirement to disclose their "material" accounting policies and adding guidance on how entities apply the concept of materiality in making decisions about accounting policy disclosures.

The amendments have had an impact on the Group's and the Company's disclosures of accounting policies, but not on the measurement, recognition or presentation of any items in the Group's and the Company's financial statements.

#### **Amendments to MFRS 112 International Tax Reform - Pillar Two Model Rules**

The Group has adopted International Tax Reform - Pillar Two Model Rules on 1 August 2023. The amendments provide a temporary mandatory relief from deferred tax accounting for the top-up tax, which is effective immediately, and require new disclosures about the Pillar Two exposure.

The Group has applied the temporary exception to recognising and disclosing information about the impact of this International Tax Reform. The Group is currently in the midst of assessing its exposure to the Pillar Two income taxes.

#### **2.3 Standards and interpretations issued but not yet effective**

The Group and the Company have not adopted the following standards and amendments to MFRSs that have been issued, but

yet to be effective:

#### **Effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2024:**

#### **Effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2025:**

Amendments to MFRS 121 Lack of Exchangeability

#### **Effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2026:**

Amendments to MFRS 1, MFRS 7, MFRS 9 MFRS 10, MFRS 107

- Annual Improvements Volume 11

#### **Deferred**

Amendments to MFRS 10 and MFRS 128 Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture

The directors expect that the adoption of the above standards and amendments to MFRSs will have no significant impact on the financial statements of the Group and the Company in the period of initial application.

{140}------------------------------------------------

- 31 July 2024

#### **NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONT'D.)**  - 31 July 2024

#### **2. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (CONT'D.)**

#### **2.4 Basis of consolidation**

The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries as at the reporting date. The financial statements of the subsidiaries used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are prepared for the same reporting date as the Company. Consistent accounting policies are applied for like transactions and events in similar circumstances.

The Group re-assesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of the three elements of control.

Profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income ("OCI") are attributed to the equity holders of the parent of the Group and to the non-controlling interests, even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.

If the Group loses control over a subsidiary, it derecognises the related assets (including goodwill), liabilities, non-controlling interest and other components of equity, while any resultant gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss.

#### **2.5 Business combinations and goodwill**

Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the consideration transferred, which is measured at acquisition date fair value, and the amount of any noncontrolling interests in the acquiree. For each business combination, the Group elects whether to measure the non-controlling interests in the acquiree at fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquiree's identifiable net assets. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred and included in administrative expenses.

Goodwill is initially measured at cost (being the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the amount recognised for non-controlling interests and any previous interest held over the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed).

After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.

#### **2.6 Investment in associated companies and joint ventures**

The Group's investment in its associate and joint venture are accounted for using the equity method.

The investment in an associate or a joint venture is initially recognised at cost using equity method. The carrying amount of the investment is adjusted to recognise changes in the Group's share of net assets of the associate or joint venture since the acquisition date.

Unrealised gains and losses resulting from transactions between the Group and the associate or joint venture are eliminated to the extent of the interest in the associate or joint venture.

After application of the equity method, the Group determines whether it is necessary to recognise an impairment loss on its investment in its associate or joint venture. At each reporting date, the Group determines whether there is objective evidence that the investment in the associate or joint venture is impaired. If there is such evidence, the Group calculates the amount of impairment as the difference between the recoverable amount of the associate or joint venture and its carrying value, and then recognises the loss within 'Share of profit of an associate and a joint venture' in profit or loss.

Upon loss of significant influence over the associate or joint control over the joint venture, the Group measures and recognises any retained investment at its fair value. Any difference between the carrying amount of the associate or joint venture upon loss of significant influence or joint control and the fair value of the retained investment and proceeds from disposal is recognised in profit or loss.

#### **2. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (CONT'D.)**

#### **2.6 Investment in associated companies and joint ventures (cont'd.)**

When the Group's effective interest in associated companies reduces over time arising from the corporate exercises that do not involve the Group, such reduction in effective interest is commonly referred to as deemed disposal. The deemed disposal gives rise to only a partial disposal, such that the Group continues to equity account the Group's interest in the associated companies and consequently gives rise to dilution gain.

The applicable accounting standard, MFRS 128 *Investment in Associates and Joint Ventures*, does not prescribe where the dilution gains should be recognised in income statement, OCI or equity. In the absence of further guidance, the Group had decided to recognise the dilution gains in the income statement. This is intended to bring the Group's reporting closer to the practice of most of the other companies and views of the relevant accounting bodies to enhance the comparability of the Group's financial statements for the benefit of users of the financial statements.

#### **2.7 Investment in joint operations**

A joint operation is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the assets, and obligations for the liabilities, relating to the arrangement. Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.

The Group and the Company account for the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses relating to its interest in joint operations in accordance with the MFRSs applicable to the particular assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses.

Profits and losses resulting from transactions between the Group and its joint operation are recognised in the Group's consolidated financial statements only to the extent of unrelated investors' interests in the joint operation.

#### **2.8 Intangible assets**

Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost. Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.

The details of intangible assets are as disclosed in Note 16.

#### **2.9 Property, plant and equipment and depreciation**

All items of property, plant and equipment are initially recorded at cost. Subsequent to recognition, property, plant and equipment except for freehold land are stated at cost net of accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any.

Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of property, plant and equipment. Subsequent costs are included in the assets' carrying value or separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.

Freehold land has an unlimited useful life and therefore is not depreciated. Construction in progress included in property, plant and equipment are not depreciated as these assets are not yet available for use.

Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, at the following annual rates:

Buildings 2% - 13% Plant and machinery 5% - 20% Office equipment, furniture and fittings 10% - 33% Motor vehicles 12% - 25%

The Group and the Company review the estimated residual values, expected useful lives of assets and methods of depreciation of property, plant and equipment at least annually. In particular, the Group and the Company consider the impact of health, safety and environmental legislation in its assessment of expected useful lives and estimated residual values.

- 31 July 2024

#### **NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONT'D.)**  - 31 July 2024

#### **2. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (CONT'D.)**

#### **2.10 Leases**

#### **As a lessee**

#### **(i) Right-of-use assets**

Right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term and the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows:

| Leasehold land        | 4 to 70 years |
|-----------------------|---------------|
| Leasehold buildings   | 2 to 70 years |
| Plant and machineries | 5 years       |
| Office equipment      | 5 years       |
| Motor vehicles        | 3 years       |

#### **(ii) Lease liabilities**

The Group and the Company recognise lease liabilities measured at the present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term.

In calculating the present value of lease payments, the Group and the Company use their incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement date because the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable.

#### **(iii) Short term leases and leases of low-value assets**

The Group and the Company apply the short-term lease recognition exemption to its short-term leases (i.e., those leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less from the commencement date and do not contain a purchase option). It also applies the lease of low-value assets recognition exemption to leases of office equipment that are considered to be low value. Lease payments on short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are recognised as expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

#### **As a lessor**

Leases in which the Group and the Company do not transfer substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of an asset are classified as operating leases. Rental income arising is accounted for on a straight-line basis over the lease terms and is included in revenue in the statement of profit or loss due to its operating nature.

#### **2.11 Construction contracts**

Where the financial outcome of a construction contract can be reliably estimated, contract revenue and contract costs are recognised as revenue and expenses respectively by using the stage of completion method. The stage of completion is determined by the proportion that contract costs incurred for work performed to date bear to the estimated total contract costs.

Where the financial outcome of a construction contract cannot be estimated reliably, contract revenue is recognised only to the extent of contract costs incurred that are likely to be recoverable. Contract costs are recognised as expenses in the period in which they are incurred.

When it is probable that total contract costs will exceed total contract revenue, the expected loss is recognised as an expense immediately.

Contract revenue comprises the initial amount of revenue agreed in the contract and variations in contract work, claims and incentive payments to the extent that it is probable that they will result in revenue and they are capable of being reliably measured.

#### **2. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (CONT'D.)**

#### **2.12 Inventories**

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realisable value.

**(a) Land held for property development**

Land held for property development (classified within non-current assets) comprise land banks which are in the process of being prepared for development but have not been launched, or where development activities are not expected to be completed within the normal operating cycle. Such land is classified within non-current assets and is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.

Cost associated with the acquisition of land includes the purchase price of the land, professional fees, stamp duties, commissions, conversion fees and other relevant levies. Generally no significant development work would have been undertaken on these lands other than project planning, infrastructure work, earth work and landscape work incurred to prepare the land for development.

Land held for property development is reclassified as property development costs at the point when development activities have commenced and where it can be demonstrated that the development activities can be completed within the normal

operating cycle.

#### **(b) Property development cost**

Property development costs comprise all costs that are directly attributable to development activities or that can be allocated on a reasonable basis to such activities.

Property development cost is subsequently recognised in profit or loss by reference to the progress towards complete satisfaction of that performance obligations at the reporting period. It is measured based on direct measurements of the value transferred by the Group to the customers and the Group's efforts or inputs to the satisfaction of the performance obligation.

Any expected loss on a development project, including costs to be incurred over the defects liability period, is recognised

as an expense immediately.

Property development costs not recognised as an expense are recognised as an asset, which is measured at the lower of

cost and net realisable value.

Property development costs of unsold unit is transferred to completed properties once the development is completed.

#### **(c) Completed properties**

Costs comprise costs of acquisition of land including all related costs incurred subsequent to the acquisition necessary to prepare the land for its intended use, related development costs to projects and direct building costs.

**(d) Raw materials, panels and work in progress**

The cost of raw materials includes the cost of purchase and other direct charges. The costs of panels and work-in-progress comprise of raw materials, direct labour, other direct costs and appropriate proportions of production overheads. Cost of inventories are accounted for using the weighted average cost method.

Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.

- 31 July 2024

#### **NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONT'D.)**  - 31 July 2024

#### **2. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (CONT'D.)**

#### **2.13 Investment properties**

Investment properties are measured initially at cost, including transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, investment properties are carried at costs less any accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses.

Freehold land has an unlimited useful life and therefore is not depreciated. Construction in progress included in investment properties are not depreciated as these assets are not yet available for use.

Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, at the following annual rates:

| Leasehold land | 2% - 13% |
|----------------|----------|
| Buildings      | 2% - 13% |

A property interest under an operating lease is classified and accounted for as an investment property on a property-by-property basis when the Group holds it to earn rentals or for capital appreciation or both. Any such property interest under an operating lease classified as an investment property is carried at cost.

#### **2.14 Taxes**

#### **(a) Current income tax**

Current income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date in the countries where the Group operates and generates taxable income.

Current income taxes are recognised in profit or loss except to the extent that the tax relates to items recognised outside profit or loss, either in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in the tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulations are subject to interpretation and establishes provisions where appropriate.

#### **(b) Deferred tax**

Deferred tax is provided using the liability method on temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes at the reporting date.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.

Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset, if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority.

#### **2.15 Employee benefits**

#### **(a) Short term benefits**

Wages, salaries, bonuses and social security contributions are recognised as an expense in the year in which the associated services are rendered by employees of the Group. Short term accumulating compensated absences such as paid annual leave are recognised when services are rendered by employees that increase their entitlement to future compensated absences. Short term non-accumulating compensated absences such as sick leave are recognised when the absences occur.

#### **2. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (CONT'D.)**

#### **2.15 Employee benefits (cont'd.)**

#### **(b) Defined contribution plans**

The Malaysian companies in the Group make contributions to the Employee Provident Fund ("EPF") in Malaysia, a defined contribution pension scheme. Contributions to defined contribution pension schemes are recognised as an expense in the period in which the related service is performed.

#### **(c) Defined benefit plans**

The Group operates an unfunded defined benefit plan for its eligible employees. The benefits are calculated based on the length of service and the agreed percentages of eligible employees' salaries over the period of their employment.

The liability in respect of a defined benefit plan is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the reporting date minus the fair value of plan assets.

The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension obligation.

Re-measurement gains and losses of post-employment benefit obligations are recognised in the Statements of Other

Comprehensive Income.

Past-service costs are recognised immediately in the Income Statements.

#### **(d) Share based compensation**

The Gamuda Berhad Employees' Share Option Scheme ("ESOS"), an equity-settled, share based compensation plan, allows the Group's employees to acquire ordinary shares of the Company. The total fair value of share options granted to employees is recognised as an employee cost with a corresponding increase in the share options reserve within equity over the vesting period and taking into account the probability that the options will vest. The fair value of share options is measured at grant date, taking into account, if any, the market vesting conditions upon which the options were granted but excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions. Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of options that are expected to become exercisable on vesting date.

At each reporting date, the Group revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to become exercisable on vesting date. It recognises the impact of the revision of original estimates, if any, in the profit or loss, and a corresponding adjustment to equity over the remaining vesting period. The equity amount is recognised in the share option reserve until the option is exercised, upon which it will be transferred to share capital, or until the option expires, upon which it will be transferred directly to retained profits.

#### **2.16 Revenue from contracts with customers and other income recognition**

Revenue from contracts with customers is recognised when control of the goods or services is transferred to the customer at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Group and the Company expect to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Other income is recognised to the extent that they are probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the Group and the Company and the other income can be reliably measured. Revenue and other income are measured at the fair value of consideration received or receivable.

#### **(a) Revenue recognition from contracts with customers**

The following specific recognition criteria must also be met before revenue and other income are recognised:

**(i) Engineering and construction contracts**

Revenue from engineering and construction contracts is accounted for by the stage of completion method as described

in Note 2.11.

{143}------------------------------------------------

- 31 July 2024

# **NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONT'D.)**

- 31 July 2024

#### **2. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (CONT'D.)**

#### **2.16 Revenue from contracts with customers and other income recognition (cont'd.)**

#### **(a) Revenue recognition from contracts with customers (cont'd.)**

#### **(ii) Property development**

Property development contracts with customers may include multiple promises to customers and are accounted for as separate performance obligations. Transaction price will be allocated to each performance obligation based on the stand-alone selling prices. When these are not directly observable, they are estimated based on expected cost-plus margin.

Revenue from property development is recognised as and when the control of the asset is transferred to the customer. Depending on the terms of the contract and the laws that apply to the contract, control of the asset may transfer over time or at a point in time. Control of the asset is transferred over time if the Group's performance does not create an asset with an alternative use to the Group and the Group has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to-date.

This is generally established when:

- the promised properties are specifically identified by its plot, lot and parcel number and its attributes (such as its size and location) in the sale and purchase agreements and the attached layout plan and the purchasers could enforce its rights to the promised properties if the Group seeks to sell the unit to another purchaser. The contractual restriction on the Group's ability to direct the promised residential property for another use is substantive and the promised properties sold to the purchasers do not have an alternative use to the Group; and
- the Group has the right to payment for performance completed to date and is entitled to continue to transfer to the customer the development units promised and has the rights to complete the construction of the properties and enforce its rights to full payments.

If control of the asset is transferred over time, revenue is recognised over the period of the contract by reference to the progress towards complete satisfaction of that performance obligation. Otherwise, the Group recognises the revenue at a point of time when the customer obtains control of the asset.

The Group recognises sales at a point in time for the sale of completed properties, when the control of the properties has been transferred to the purchasers, being when the properties have been completed and delivered to the customers.

#### **(iii) Sale of goods and services**

Revenue relating to the sale of goods is recognised net of discounts upon the transfer of significant control of the goods to the customer. Revenue from services rendered is recognised net of service taxes and discount as and when the services are performed. Sale of goods and services of the Group includes trading of construction materials, quarry sales and sales of manufactured products.

#### **(iv) Supply of water and related services**

Revenue from management, operation and maintenance of dams and water treatment facilities are recognised net of discounts as and when the services are performed.

#### **(v) Dividend income**

Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is established.

#### **(vi) Club membership entrance fees and annual fees**

Membership entrance fees from members represent 20% of the membership fees whereas membership annual fees represent the remaining 80% of the membership fees. The membership entrance fees are received upfront and recognised on a straight-line basis over the tenure of the membership.

Interest is recognised by using effective interest rate method.

#### **(ii) Rental income**

Rental income is recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. The aggregate cost of incentives provided to lessees is recognised as a reduction of rental income over the lease term on a straight-line basis.

#### **2.17 Foreign currencies**

#### **(a) Functional and presentation currency**

The Group's consolidated financial statements are presented in Ringgit Malaysia ("RM"), alternatively referred to as the Malaysian Ringgit ("MYR"), which is also the parent company's functional currency. For each entity, the Group determines the functional currency and items included in the financial statements of each entity are measured using that functional currency. The Group uses the direct method of consolidation and on disposal of a foreign operation, the gain or loss that is reclassified to profit or loss reflects the amount that arises from using this method.

#### **(b) Transactions and balances**

Differences arising on settlement or translation of monetary items are recognised in profit or loss with the exception of monetary items that are designated as part of the hedge of the Group's net investment in a foreign operation.

In determining the spot exchange rate to use on initial recognition of the related asset, expense or income (or part of it) on the derecognition of a non-monetary asset or non-monetary liability relating to advance consideration, the date of the transaction is the date on which the Group initially recognises the non-monetary asset or non-monetary liability arising from the advance consideration. If there are multiple payments or receipts in advance, the Group determines the transaction date for each payment or receipt of advance consideration.

#### **(c) Group companies**

On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into RM at the rate of exchange prevailing at the reporting date and their statements of profit or loss are translated at exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. The exchange differences arising on translation for consolidation are recognised in OCI. On disposal of a foreign operation, the component of OCI relating to that particular foreign operation is reclassified to profit or loss.

Any goodwill arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation and any fair value adjustments to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities arising on the acquisition are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign operation and translated at the spot rate of exchange at the reporting date.

The principal exchange rates used for every unit of foreign currency ruling at the reporting date are as follows:

|                      | 2024<br>RM | 2023<br>RM |
|----------------------|------------|------------|
|                      |            |            |

#### **NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONT'D.)**  - 31 July 2024

#### **2. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (CONT'D.)**

#### **2.18 Financial assets**

#### **Initial recognition and measurement**

Financial assets are classified, at initial recognition, as subsequently measured at amortised cost, fair value through OCI, and fair value through profit or loss.

The Group and the Company's financial assets at amortised cost, fair value through OCI and fair value through profit or loss are disclosed in Note 21.

This category includes derivative instruments and listed equity investments which the Group and the Company had not irrevocably elected to classify at fair value through OCI.

#### **2.19 Impairment of financial assets**

The Group recognises an allowance for expected credit losses ("ECLs") for all debt instruments not held at fair value through profit or loss. ECLs are based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due in accordance with the contract and all the cash flows that the Group expects to receive, discounted at an approximation of the original effective interest rate. The expected cash flows will include cash flows from the sale of collateral held or other credit enhancements that are integral to the contractual terms.

For trade receivables and contract assets, the Group applies a simplified approach in calculating ECLs. Therefore, the Group does not track changes in credit risk, but instead recognises a loss allowance based on lifetime ECLs at each reporting date. The Group has established a provision matrix that is based on its historical credit loss experience, adjusted for forward-looking factors specific to the debtors and the economic environment.

For debt instruments at fair value through OCI, the Group applies the low credit risk simplification. At every reporting date, the Group evaluates whether the debt instrument is considered to have low credit risk using all reasonable and supportable information that is available without undue cost or effort. In making that evaluation, the Group reassesses the internal credit rating of the debt instrument. In addition, the Group considers that there has been a significant increase in credit risk when contractual payments are more than 30 days past due.

The Group considers a financial asset in default when contractual payments are 90 days past due. However, in certain cases, the Group may also consider a financial asset to be in default when internal or external information indicates that the Group is unlikely to receive the outstanding contractual amounts in full before taking into account any credit enhancements held by the Group. A financial asset is written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovering the contractual cash flows.

#### **2.20 Cash and cash equivalents**

Cash and cash equivalents in the statement of financial position comprise cash and bank balances comprise cash at banks, cash on hand and short-term deposits with a maturity of three months or less, which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.

For the purpose of the consolidated statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and bank balances, short-term deposits, as defined above as they are considered an integral part of the Group's cash management.

#### **2.21 Share capital and share issuance expenses**

Ordinary shares are recorded at the proceeds received, net of directly attributable incremental transaction costs. Ordinary shares are accounted for in shareholders' equity as an appropriation of retained earnings and accrued as liability in the financial year in which the obligation to pay is established.

#### **2. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (CONT'D.)**

#### **2.22 Financial liabilities**

#### **Initial recognition and measurement**

Financial liabilities are classified, at initial recognition, as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, loans and borrowings, payables, or as derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge, as appropriate.

All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and, in the case of loans and borrowings and payables, net of directly

attributable transaction costs.

#### **Subsequent measurement**

For purposes of subsequent measurement, financial liabilities are classified into financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss or financial liabilities at amortised cost as disclosed in Note 30.

#### **2.23 Borrowing costs**

Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset that necessarily takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use or sale are capitalised as part of the cost of the asset. All other borrowing costs are expensed in the period in which they occur. Borrowing costs consist of interest and other costs that an entity incurs in connection with the borrowing of funds.

#### **2.24 Fair value measurement**

The Group measures financial instruments, such as quoted and unquoted securities and non-financial assets such as investment properties at fair value at each reporting date.

Policies and procedures are determined by the Group for both recurring fair value measurement and for non-recurring measurement.

External valuers are involved for valuation of significant assets, such as investment properties. Selection criteria of external valuers include market knowledge, reputation, independence and whether professional standards are maintained. The management decides, after discussions with the Group's external valuers, which valuation techniques and inputs to use for each case.

At each reporting date, the management analyses the movement in the values of assets and liabilities which are required to be re-measured or re-assessed as per the Group's accounting policies. For this analysis, the management verifies the major inputs applied in the latest valuation by agreeing the information in the valuation computation to contracts and other relevant documents.

For the purpose of fair value disclosures, the Group has determined classes of assets and liabilities on the basis of the nature, characteristics and risks of the asset or liability and the level of the fair value hierarchy.

- 31 July 2024

#### **NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONT'D.)**  - 31 July 2024

#### **2. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (CONT'D.)**

#### **2.25 Contract assets and contract liabilities**

A contract asset is the right of the Group to consideration in exchange for goods or services that it has transferred to the customer when that right is conditional upon future performance but not through the passage of time. If the Group has performed its obligation by transferring goods or services to a customer before the customer pays consideration or before payment is due, a contract asset is recognised and presented net of any amounts that has been recognised as receivables. Contract asset is the excess of cumulative revenue earned or recognised in profit or loss over the billings to date to the customer. Contract assets are subject to impairment assessment in accordance of MFRS 9.

A contract liability is the obligation of the Group to transfer goods and services to a customer for which it has received consideration or an amount of consideration is due from the customer. If a customer pays consideration, such as advance payment and down payments, or the Group has a right to an amount of consideration that is unconditional before it transfers goods or services to the customer, a contract liability is recognised when the payment is made or the payment is due (whichever is earlier). Contract liabilities are recognised as revenue when the Group performs its obligation under the contract. Contract liability is the excess of the billings to date to the customer over the cumulative revenue earned or recognised in profit or loss.

#### **2.26 Provisions**

Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.

If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax rate that reflects, when appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. When discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost.

#### **2.27 Subsidiaries**

In the Company's separate financial statements, investments in subsidiaries are accounted for at cost less impairment losses. On disposal of such investments, the difference between net disposal proceeds and their carrying amounts is included in profit or loss.

#### **2.28 Non-current assets held for sale/distribution and discontinued operations**

The Group and the Company classify non-current assets and disposal groups as held for sale/distribution if their carrying amounts will be recovered principally through a sale/distribution transaction rather than through continuing use. Non-current assets and disposal groups classified as held for sale/distribution are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Costs to sell are the incremental costs directly attributable to the disposal of an asset ("disposal group"), excluding finance costs and income tax expense.

The criteria for held for sale/distribution classification is regarded as met only when the sale/distribution is highly probable, and the asset or disposal group is available for immediate sale/distribution in its present condition. Actions required to complete the sale/distribution should indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the sale/distribution will be made or that the decision to sell/distribute will be withdrawn. Management must be committed to the plan to sell/distribute the asset and the sale/ distribution is expected to be completed within one year from the date of the classification.

Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets are not depreciated or amortised once classified as held for sale/distribution.

Assets and liabilities classified as held for sale/distribution are presented separately as current items in the statement of financial position.

Discontinued operations are excluded from the results of continuing operations and are presented as a single amount as profit or loss after tax from discontinued operations in the statement of profit or loss.

Additional disclosures are provided in Note 42. All other notes to the financial statements include amounts for continuing operations, unless indicated otherwise.

#### **2. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (CONT'D.)**

#### **2.29 Climate-related matters**

The Group considers climate-related matters in estimates and assumptions, where appropriate. This assessment includes a wide range of possible impacts on the group due to both physical and transition risks. Even though the Group believes its business model and products will still be viable after the transition to a low-carbon economy, climate-related matters increase the uncertainty in estimates and assumptions underpinning several items in the financial statements. Even though climaterelated risks might not currently have a significant impact on measurement, the Group is closely monitoring relevant changes and developments, such as new climate-related legislation. The items and considerations that are most directly impacted by climaterelated matters are:

(a) Useful life of property, plant and equipment. When reviewing the residual values and expected useful lives of assets, the Group considers climate-related matters, such as climate-related legislation and regulations that may restrict the use of

- assets or require significant capital expenditures.
- 
- 

(b) Impairment of non-financial assets. The value-in-use may be impacted in several different ways by transition risk in particular, such as climate-related legislation and regulations and changes in demand for the Group's products.

(c) Fair value measurement. For investment properties and revalued office properties, the Group considers the effect of physical and transition risks and whether investors would consider those risks in their valuation. The group believes it is not currently exposed to severe physical risks, but believes that investors, to some extent, would consider impacts of transition risks in their valuation, such as increasing requirements for energy efficiency of buildings due to climate-related legislation and regulations as tenants' increasing demands for low-emission buildings.

#### **3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS**

The preparation of the Group's and of the Company's financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the reporting date. However, uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that could require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of the asset or liability affected in the future.

#### **3.1 Judgements made in applying accounting policies**

In the process of applying the Group's and the Company's accounting policies, management has made the following critical judgements which could have a significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements as discussed below:

#### **Non-consolidation of entities in which the Group holds more than a majority of shareholding interest**

(i) Investment in Sistem Penyuraian Trafik KL Barat Holdings Sdn. Bhd. ("SPRINT Holdings")

The Group does not consider that it controls SPRINT Holdings even though the Group holds an effective shareholding interest of 51% in SPRINT Holdings. This is because the Group only holds a direct voting right of 30% in SPRINT Holdings. The remaining 21% of the equity share in SPRINT Holdings is held via another associated company of the Group, Lingkaran Trans Kota Holdings Berhad ("LITRAK Holdings"), vis a vis indirect interest owned by the Group. The Group does not control LITRAK Holdings. As a result, the Group does not hold a majority voting right in SPRINT Holdings and therefore, SPRINT Holdings is considered as an associated company. Hence, the share of results and share net assets in SPRINT Holdings will be accounted by the Group using the equity method.

#### **3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS (CONT'D.)**

#### **3.1 Judgements made in applying accounting policies (cont'd.)**

In the process of applying the Group's and the Company's accounting policies, management has made the following critical judgements which could have a significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements as discussed below: (cont'd.)

#### **Non-consolidation of entities in which the Group holds more than a majority of shareholding interest (cont'd.)**

(ii) Investment in Venta Belgarum Limited Partnership ("JVLP"), Venta Belgarum G. P. Limited ("JVGP") and Wessex Winchester Propco ("Prop Co")

The Group does not consider that it controls JVLP, JVGP and Prop Co even though Gamuda Land (Labuan) Limited ("GLL") owns 75% direct interest in JVLP, JVGP and Prop Co on the following basis:

- The Partnership Business Plan ("PBP") and any updates to the PBP (which stipulates the relevant activities) are part of Reserved Matters that requires unanimous consent from both shareholders; and
- Distribution of profits which is also a Reserved Matters requires unanimous consent from both shareholders.

These joint arrangements are the joint ventures to the Group given that these joint arrangements provided the respective shareholders the rights to net assets of Prop Co via JVGP and JVLP. Hence, the share of results and share net assets in Prop Co will be accounted by the Group using the equity method.

(iii) Investment in QIP Straits ll Limited Partnership ("QIP ll") and B Woolwich Limited ("Woolwich")

The Group does not consider that it controls QIP ll and Woolwich even though Gamuda PBSA Limited ("PBSA") owns 90% direct interest in QIP ll; 87.75% effective equity interest in Woolwich on the following basis:

- The PBP and any updates to the PBP (which stipulates the relevant activities) are part of Reserved Matters that requires unanimous consent from both shareholders; and
- Distribution of profits which is also a Reserved Matters requires unanimous consent from both shareholders.

These joint arrangements are the joint ventures to the Group given that these joint arrangements provided the respective shareholders the rights to net assets of Woolwich via QIP ll. Hence, the share of results and share net assets in Woolwich will be accounted by the Group using the equity method.

(iv) Investment in Neda Pekan Sdn Bhd ("Neda Pekan")

The Group does not consider that it controls Neda Pekan even though the Group holds an effective shareholding interest of 64.3% (2023: 56.4%) because the Group only holds a direct voting right of 49% in Neda Pekan. The remaining 15.3% (2023: 7.4%) of the equity share in Neda Pekan is held via another associated company of the Group, ERS Energy Sdn. Bhd. Hence, the share of results in Neda Pekan will be accounted by the Group using the equity method.

#### **3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS (CONT'D.)**

#### **3.2 Key sources of estimation uncertainty**

The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting date, that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below:

#### **(a) Revenue and costs from property development activities and construction contracts**

The Group and the Company recognise contract revenue and construction contract costs in the profit or loss by using the stage of completion method. The stage of completion is determined by the proportion of contract costs incurred for work performed to date compared to the estimated total contract costs.

The Group recognises property development revenue and costs by reference to the progress towards complete satisfaction of that performance obligations at the reporting period. It is measured based on direct measurements of the value transferred by the Group to the customers and the Group's efforts or inputs to the satisfaction of the performance obligation.

Significant estimation is involved in determining the stage of completion and progress towards complete satisfaction of that performance obligations at the reporting period, the extent of the contract or property development costs incurred, the estimated total contract or property development revenue and costs, as well as the recoverability of the contracts or development projects. In making the estimation, the Group and the Company evaluate based on past experiences and by relying on the work of specialists.

Where the total actual revenue and cost incurred are different from the total estimated revenue and cost incurred, such differences will impact the contract profit or losses recognised.

The carrying amount of the Group's property development costs at the reporting date is disclosed in Note 13(b).

The carrying amount of the Group's and the Company's contract assets/(liabilities) for construction contracts at the reporting

date is disclosed in Note 22.

#### **(b) Impairment of investments in subsidiaries, associated companies and joint ventures**

The Group and the Company assess at each reporting date whether there are indicators of impairment for its investments in subsidiaries, associated companies and joint ventures. The recoverable amounts are determined based on fair value less costs of disposal and value in use calculations.

For recoverable amounts determined based on value in use calculation, significant judgement is required in the estimation of the present value of future cash flows generated by the cash-generating units, which involves uncertainties and are significantly affected by assumptions used and judgement made regarding estimates of future cash flows and discount rates. Further information on impairment assessments performed during the year are as disclosed in Note 17(c).

#### **(c) Impairment assessment on property, plant and equipment ("PPE")**

The Group and the Company assess whether there are any indicators of impairment for all non-financial assets at each reporting date. The recoverable amounts are determined based on the higher of value in use and fair value less costs of disposal.

Estimating the recoverable amount by using value in use involves estimating the future cash inflows and outflows that will be derived from these assets and discounting them at an appropriate rate.

For recoverable amounts determined based on value in use calculation, significant judgement is required in the estimation of the present value of future cash flows generated by the cash-generating units, which involves uncertainties and are significantly affected by assumptions used and judgement made regarding estimates of future cash flows and discount rates as disclosed in Note 12(a).

#### **3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS (CONT'D.)**

#### **3.2 Key sources of estimation uncertainty (cont'd.)**

The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting date, that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below: (cont'd.)

#### **(d) Impairment assessment of goodwill**

The Group performs an impairment test on its goodwill at least on an annual basis. This requires an estimation of the VIU of the CGU to which goodwill are allocated. Estimating a VIU amount requires management to make an estimate of the expected future cash flows from the CGU and also to choose a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of those cash flows. Further details of the carrying amounts, the key assumptions applied in the impairment assessment and sensitivity analysis to changes in the assumptions are disclosed in Note 16 (c).

#### **(e) Income tax**

Significant judgement and estimates are used in arriving at taxable profits for the year and for prior years, including assessing the deductibility of expense items for tax purposes. Management are guided by tax laws/cases on such instances. Management believes that all deductions claimed, in arriving at taxable profits for current and prior years, are appropriate and justifiable.

#### **(f) Deferred tax assets**

Deferred tax assets are recognised for all unused tax losses, unabsorbed capital allowances and other deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the unused tax losses, unabsorbed capital allowances and other deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Significant management judgement is required to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognised, based upon the likely timing and level of future taxable profits together with future tax planning strategies. The total carrying value of recognised and unrecognised tax losses, capital allowances and other deductible temporary differences of the Group and of the Company are as disclosed in Note 32.

#### **(g) Net realisable value of completed property development units classified as inventories**

Inventories held for sale are stated at the lower of cost or net realisable value. The Group estimates the net realisable value of inventories based on an assessment of expected sales prices.

Inventories held for sale are reviewed on a regular basis and the Group will make an allowance for impairment primarily based on historical trends and management estimates of expected and future product demand and related pricing.

Demand and pricing levels could change from time to time. If such factors result in an adverse effect on the Group's products, the Group provides additional allowances for slow moving inventories.

The carrying amount of the Group's completed property units as at reporting date is disclosed in Note 13(c).

#### **3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS (CONT'D.)**

#### **3.2 Key sources of estimation uncertainty (cont'd.)**

The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting date, that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below: (cont'd.)

#### **(h) Provision for affordable housing**

Provision for affordable housing is recognised for anticipated losses to be incurred for the development of low cost housing under the requirements of the local Government attributable to a premium housing project. The Group is of the view that the expected costs should be accrued progressively as and when the premium housing is constructed. The provision for affordable housing represents the shortfall between the cost of constructing affordable housing and the economic benefits expected to be received from the purchasers of affordable housing in the development of affordable housing on involuntary basis. This provision is capitalised in the form of common costs for development of premium housing based on the following conditions:

- The master and building plans is approved;
- The developer commenced development; and
- 

- Sales of the affordable housing are controlled, whereby eligibility of buyers is dictated by the authority and the developer has no ability to impose selling price higher than what the authority dictates.

In determining the provision for affordable housing, estimates and assumptions are made by the Group on the structure and construction costs in constructing the affordable housing. In making those judgements, the Group evaluates the provisions based on past experience.

The carrying amount of the Group's provision for affordable housing as at reporting date is disclosed in Note 37(b).

#### **(i) Provision of expected credit loss of trade receivables, other receivables and contract assets**

The Group and the Company assess the credit risk at each reporting date, whether there have been significant increases in credit risk since initial recognition on an individual basis. To determine whether there is a significant increase in credit risks, the Group and the Company consider factors such as the probability of insolvency or significant financial difficulties of the debtors and default or significant delay in payments.

Where there is a significant increase in credit risk, the Group and the Company determine the lifetime expected credit loss by considering the loss given default and the probability of default assigned to each counterparty customer. The financial assets are written off either partially or full when there is no realistic prospect of recovery. This typically happens when the Group and the Company determine that the debtor does not have sufficient assets or income sources to generate the cash flows necessary to repay the amount being written off.

The carrying amounts of the trade and other receivables and contract assets are disclosed in Notes 21 and 22 respectively.

The capitalisation rate used to determine the amount of borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation during the financial year was 5.20% (2023: 5.02%) per annum. The increase in finance costs is primarily attributable to higher borrowings, particularly in foreign currencies, to finance new investments in Australia and Vietnam.

#### **NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONT'D.)**  - 31 July 2024

#### **12. PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT (CONT'D.)**

(a) As at 31 July 2024, the Group's accumulated impairment losses in respect of its subsidiary, Gamuda Industrial Building System Sdn. Bhd. ("GIBS")'s property, plant and equipment amounted to RM148,100,000 (2023: RM148,100,000).

During the year, the carrying amount of its property, plant and equipment amounted to RM298,515,000 (2023: RM304,184,000) was tested for impairment as GIBS had been recording continued losses. The recoverable amount of the property, plant and equipment was determined based on the higher of value in use or fair value less costs of disposal calculations.

The recoverable amount was determined based on value in use calculation. The cash flow projections were prepared based on the remaining useful life of plant and machinery as at 31 July 2024, which is 15 years (2023: 16 years). The pre-tax discount rate applied to the cash flow projections is 18.5% (2023: 16.3%) per annum.

#### **Key assumptions used in value in use calculation**

- (i) Sales volume Based on secured projects and approved sales plan.
- (ii) Projected margin Projected margin reflects the average historical margin adjusted for projected market and economic conditions and internal resource efficiency.
- (iii) Pre-tax discount rate Discount rate is used to reflect management's estimate of the risks specific to the CGU. In determining appropriate discount rate, consideration has been given to the applicable weighted average cost of capital.

The abovementioned impairment testing did not give rise to additional impairment losses for its property, plant and equipment.

#### **Sensitivity to changes in key assumptions**

- a) Sales volume A decrease of 5% (2023: 5%) in the projected sales volume would have decreased the value in use by RM28,009,000 (2023: RM24,237,000).
- b) Projected margin A decrease of 1% (2023: 1%) in the projected margin would have decreased the value in use by RM24,838,000 (2023: RM18,110,000).
- c) Pre-tax discount rate An increase of 0.5% (2023: 0.5%) in the pre-tax discount rate used would have decreased the value in use by RM7,098,000 (2023: RM8,741,000).

Bhd. which has been granted the development rights to commence, manage, carry out and complete the project development of island. This expenditure comprises the dregding and reclamation works, revetment and rock bunds, soil improvement works and other related costs in connection with the land reclamation.

This expenditure is recognised to the extent that the Group has performed the construction services of the project development of island and the costs incurred that are expected to be recoverable. Land reclamation and development expenditure is stated at cost less accumulated impairment losses.

This expenditure will be derecognised upon sale of reclaimed land.

#### **(b) Water development expenditure**

The water development expenditure ("WDE") is attributable to Gamuda Water Sdn. Bhd. which has been granted the rights to manage, operate and maintain Sungai Selangor Water Treatment Plant Phase 3 ("SSP 3") for a period of 8 years from 2019 to 2027. WDE comprises of rehabilitation and restoration capital expenditure in connection with the operations and maintenance of water concession and is an intangible asset with finite useful life.

WDE incurred are measured initially at cost and are amortised upon commencement of the operation of SSP 3 over the concession period of 8 years.

#### **(c) Goodwill**

Goodwill arising from business combinations has been allocated to 2 cash-generating units ("CGU)" as follows:

- (i) DT Infrastructure Pty Ltd ("DTI") which provides civil construction services in delivering transport projects for its customers, with specialist rail capability. The carrying amount of goodwill allocated to this CGU is RM493,245,000 (2023: RM499,417,000).

Goodwill allocated to DTI is significant in comparison with the Group's total goodwill. The Group performed an impairment test on its goodwill at least on an annual basis. The recoverable amounts of the DTI have been determined based on the value-in-use calculations using cash flow projections from the financial budgets approved by the management covering a five year period and applying a terminal growth rate of 2% per annum. Management has applied a pre-tax discount rate of 16%.

#### **(c) Goodwill (cont'd)**

#### **Key assumptions used in value-in-use calculation**

(i) Projected revenue - Projected revenue is based on the future win rate of projects tendered for, but not yet won.

(ii) Pre-tax discount rate - Discount rate is used to reflect management's estimate of the risks specific to the CGU. In determining the appropriate discount rate, consideration has been given to the applicable weighted average cost of capital.

(iii) Projected margin - Projected margin reflects the average historical margin adjusted for projected market and economic

- 
- 
- conditions and internal resource efficiency.
- term average growth rate for the industries.

(iv) Terminal growth rate - The forecasted growth rates are based on published industry research and do not exceed the long-

#### **Sensitivity to changes in key assumptions**

(i) Projected revenue – A decrease of 1% in the projected orderbook would have decreased the value in use by RM56,070,000.

(ii) Pre-tax discount rate – An increase of 0.5% in the pre-tax discount rate used would have decreased the value in use by

- 
- RM186,590,000.

#### **(c) Impairment assessment of investment in subsidiary**

As at 31 July 2024, the accumulated impairment losses in respect of cost of investment in GIBS amounted to RM285,000,000 (2023: RM285,000,000).

As at the reporting date, the cost of investment of GIBS amounting to RM409,500,000 (2023: RM400,500,000) was tested for impairment as GIBS had been recording continued losses since previous years. The recoverable amount was determined based on the higher of value in use or fair value less costs of disposal calculations.

The recoverable amount was determined based on value in use calculation. The cash flow projections are prepared based on recent financial budgets covering a 15-year period (2023: 16-year period) and applying a terminal growth rate of 2% (2023: 2%) per annum. The pre-tax discount rate applied to the cash flow projections is 17.1% (2023: 13.2%) per annum.

#### **Key assumptions used in value in use calculation**

- (i) Sales volume Based on secured projects and approved sales plan.
- (ii) Projected margin Projected margin reflects the average historical margin adjusted for projected market and economic conditions and internal resource efficiency.
- (iii) Pre-tax discount rate Discount rate is used to reflect management's estimate of the risks specific to the CGU. In determining appropriate discount rate, consideration has been given to the applicable weighted average cost of capital.
- (iv) Terminal growth rate The forecasted growth rates are based on published industry research and do not exceed the longterm average growth rate for the industries.

The abovementioned impairment testing did not give rise to additional impairment losses of cost of investment.

#### **Sensitivity to changes in key assumptions**

- a) Sales volume A decrease of 5% (2023: 5%) in the projected sales volume would have decreased the value in use by RM37,832,000 (2023: RM32,806,000).
- b) Projected margin A decrease of 1% (2023: 1%) in the projected margin would have decreased the value in use by RM32,867,000 (2023: RM24,058,000).
- c) Pre-tax discount rate An increase of 0.5% (2023: 0.5%) in the pre-tax discount rate used would have decreased the value in use by RM15,516,000 (2023: RM19,831,000).

#### **NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONT'D.)**  - 31 July 2024

#### **21. RECEIVABLES AND OTHER FINANCIAL ASSETS (CONT'D.)**

Receivables of the Group and of the Company are analysed as follows: (cont'd.)

#### **(a) Current (cont'd.)**

**(i) Trade receivables (cont'd.)**

#### Receivables that are past due but not impaired

The Group and the Company have trade receivables amounting to RM344,641,000 (2023: RM277,977,000) and RM172,310,000 (2023: RM123,369,000) respectively that are past due at the reporting date but not impaired. The receivables are related to customers with ongoing transactions and/or progressive payments, and unsecured in nature.

An impairment analysis is performed at each reporting date using a provision matrix to measure expected credit losses. The provision rates are based on days past due for grouping of various customer segments with similar loss patterns. The calculation reflects the probability-weighted outcome, the time value of money and reasonable and supportable information that is available at the reporting date about past events, current conditions and for more than one year and forecasts of future economic conditions. Generally, trade receivables are written-off if past due for more than one year and are not subject to enforcement activity. The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the carrying value of each class of financial assets disclosed above.

#### Receivables that are impaired

The Group's and the Company's trade receivables that are individually impaired at the reporting date and the movement of the allowance accounts used to record the impairment are as follows:

|                                     | Group          |                |

Receivables that are impaired (cont'd.)

The Group's and the Company's trade receivables that are individually impaired at the reporting date and the movement of the allowance accounts used to record the impairment are as follows: (cont'd.)

During the financial year, a reversal of impairment loss on trade receivables amounting to RM52,946,000 (2023: Nil) was recognised in the Income Statements as negotiations with a client during the year resulted in the imminent recovery of the claims for change orders issued by the client. The amount was fully impaired in previous year.

#### **NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONT'D.)**  - 31 July 2024

#### **26. SHARE CAPITAL (CONT'D.)**

#### (g) Fair value of share options granted

The fair value of the share options granted under the ESOS is estimated at grant date using a binomial option pricing model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the instruments were granted. In previous financial year, modification made to the share options is the price adjustment in accordance with the Company's ESOS By-laws pursuant to the distribution on special dividend effective on 14 December 2022.

The fair value of share options measured at the respective date and the assumptions are as follows:

The expected volatility is based on historical data and is not necessarily indicative of exercise patterns that may occur.

*# Expected dividend yield is assumed on the expected term of the options as at grant dates.*

The availability of the unutilised tax losses and unabsorbed capital allowances for offsetting against future taxable profits of the Group are subject to no substantial changes in shareholdings of the respective companies under the Income Tax Act, 1967, and guidelines issued by the tax authority.

Based on the Malaysia Finance Act 2021, gazetted on 31 December 2021, the time limit for the carry forward of the unutilised tax losses has been extended from 7 years to 10 years. As a result of this change, the unutilised tax losses accumulated up to the YA 2018 are allowed to be carried forward for 10 consecutive years of assessment. Any balance of the unutilised tax losses thereafter shall be disregarded.

The unutilised tax losses in Singapore and Australia, subject to certain conditions, could be carried forward indefinitely to offset against their future taxable income. While for the unutilised tax losses in Vietnam, subject to certain conditions, could be carried forward to a maximum period of 5 consecutive years.

Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of the above items as it is not probable that future taxable profits will be available in the Company and certain subsidiaries against which the Group can utilise the benefits.

| CCIRS loan (Note 34(b)) | 967,361 | 963,017 |

The Group uses cross currency interest rate swap to manage some of its transaction exposure from foreign currency loan. These contracts are not designated as cash flow or fair value hedges and are entered into for periods consistent with currency transaction exposure and fair value changes exposure. Such derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting.

At the reporting date, the Group's loans denominated in United States Dollar ("USD") amounted to USD220,000,000 (2023: USD220,000,000) ("USD loan"). At the same time, Group entered into a cross currency interest rate swap ("CCIRS") to hedge against floating interest rate and foreign exchange movements for the USD loan ("CCIRS loan"). The CCIRS loan has been accounted for as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss. Any changes in the fair value of the CCIRS loan will be recognised to profit or loss.

Details of CCIRS loan are as follows:

- 
- 

The following methods and assumptions are used to estimate fair values of the following classes of financial instruments:

#### **(i) Non-current receivables, payables and borrowings**

The fair value of these financial instruments are estimated by discounting expected future cash flows at market incremental lending rate/profit rate for similar types of lending or borrowing arrangements or Islamic debts at the reporting date.

#### **(ii) Cash and bank balances, current receivables and current payables**

The carrying amounts of these financial assets and liabilities are reasonable approximation of fair values due to their short-term

nature.

#### **(iii) Financial guarantees**

Fair value is determined based on probability weighted discounted cash flow method. The probability has been estimated and assigned for the following key assumptions:

- 
- 
- 

- The likelihood of the guaranteed party defaulting within the guaranteed period;

- The exposure on the portion that is not expected to be recovered due to the guaranteed party's default; and - The estimated loss exposure if the party guaranteed were to default.

#### **43. FAIR VALUE (CONT'D.)**

The following methods and assumptions are used to estimate fair values of the following classes of financial instruments: (cont'd.)

#### **(iv) CCIRS loan**

CCIRS are valued using a valuation technique with market observable inputs. The frequently applied valuation technique includes forecasting the future cash flows using the forward rates and discounting them, using present value calculation. The models incorporate various inputs including the credit quality of counter parties, foreign exchange and interest spot and forward rates, interest rate curves and forward rate curves.

#### **Fair value hierarchy**

The Group's and the Company's financial instruments are analysed in a three level fair value hierarchy based on the significance of inputs.

The three level of fair value measurement hierarchy are:

- Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Group and the Company can access at the measurement date
- Level 2: Input other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices)
- Level 3: Input for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable input)

#### **NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONT'D.)**  - 31 July 2024

#### **43. FAIR VALUE (CONT'D.)**

#### **Investment properties**

The fair value of the investment properties are based on the following valuation techniques depending on the location and types of properties:

#### **(a) Comparison method**

The comparison method seeks to determine the value of the property being valued by comparing and adopting as a yardstick transactions and sales evidences involving other similar properties in the vicinity. Due considerations, are given for such factors including location, plot size, improvements made if any, surrounding developments, facilities and amenities available.

#### **(b) Income approach**

The income approach uses valuation techniques to convert estimated future amounts of cash flows or income to a single present value (discounted) amount. To this estimated future amounts of cash flows or income, an appropriate, market-derived discount rate is applied to establish the present value of the income stream associated with the real property.

#### **(c) Depreciable replacement cost method**

Completed buildings are valued by reference to the current estimates on construction costs to erect equivalent buildings, taking into consideration of similar buildings in terms of size, construction, finishes, contractors' overheads, fees and profits. Appropriate adjustments are then made for the factors of obsolescence and existing physical condition of the building.

#### **(a) Credit risk (cont'd.)**

#### **Trade receivables and contract assets (cont'd.)**

An impairment analysis is performed at each reporting date using provision matrix to measure expected credit losses. The provision rates are based on days past due for groupings of various customer segments with similar loss patterns (i.e. by geographical region, product type, customer type and rating). The calculation reflects the probability-weighted outcome, the time value of money and reasonable and supportable information that is available at the reporting date about past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions. Generally, trade receivables are written-off if past due for more than one year and are not subject to enforcement activity. The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the carrying value of each class of financial assets disclosed in Note 21. The Group does not hold collateral as security. The Group evaluates the credit risk with respect to trade receivables and contract assets as low as there is no concentration of trade receivables. The directors do not foresee any issue in recovering the receivable amount.

#### **Financial instruments and cash deposits**

Credit risk from balances with banks and financial institutions is managed by the Group's treasury department in accordance with the Group's policy. The Group invests only on quoted debt securities with very low credit risk.

The Group's maximum exposure to credit risk for the components of the statement of financial position at 31 July 2024 and 2023 is the carrying amount as illustrated in Note 21 except for derivative financial instruments. The Group's maximum exposure relating to financial derivative instruments is noted in the liquidity table below.

#### **Financial guarantees**

For financial guarantees and similar contracts granted, it is the maximum amount that the Group and the Company would have to pay if the guarantees were called upon. The maximum exposure has been disclosed in Note 44(b).

#### **Credit risk concentration profile**

The Group determines concentrations of credit risk by monitoring the country and industry sector profile of its trade receivables on an ongoing basis. The credit risk concentration profile of the Group's trade receivables at the reporting date are as follows:

#### **NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONT'D.)**  - 31 July 2024

#### **44. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES (CONT'D.)**

#### **(b) Liquidity risk**

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group or the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting financial obligations due to shortage of funds. The Group's and the Company's exposure to liquidity risk arises primarily from mismatches of the maturities of financial assets and liabilities. The Group's and the Company's objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of stand-by bank borrowings.

At the reporting date, approximately 16% (2023: 20%) of the Group's debts and borrowings (Notes 33 and 34) will mature in less than one year based on the carrying amount reflected in the financial statements. Approximately 19% (2023: 22%) of the Company's debts and borrowings (Notes 33 and 34) will mature in less than one year at the reporting date.

#### **Analysis of financial instruments by remaining contractual maturities**

The table below summarises the maturity profile of the Group's and the Company's liabilities at the reporting date based on contractual undiscounted repayment obligations.

- 31 July 2024

#### **44. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES (CONT'D.)**

**(b) Liquidity risk (cont'd.)**

#### **Analysis of financial instruments by remaining contractual maturities (cont'd.)**

As at the reporting date, the counterparties to the financial guarantees do not have the right to demand cash as there is no default event by the subsidiaries and joint venture companies.

Maturity analysis of financial guarantees is disclosed as follows:

|                      | 2024<br>RM'000 | 2023<br>RM'000 |
|----------------------|----------------|----------------|

#### **(c) Interest rate risk**

Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of the Group's and the Company's financial instruments will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates.

The Group's and the Company's exposure to interest rate risk arises primarily from their loans and borrowings.

The Group's policy is to manage interest cost using a mix of fixed and floating rate debts. At the reporting date, approximately 53% (2023: 58%) of the Group's borrowings are at fixed rates of interest.

#### Sensitivity analysis for interest rate risk

At the reporting date, if interest rates had been 0.25% lower/higher, with all other variables held constant, the Group's profit net of tax would have been RM7,009,000 (2023: RM5,530,000) higher/lower, arising mainly as a result of lower/higher interest expense on floating rate loans and borrowings. The assumed movement in basis points for interest rate sensitivity analysis is based on the currently observable market environment.

#### **(d) Market price risk**

Market price risk is the risk that the fair value or the future cash flows of the Group's and the Company's financial instruments will fluctuate because of changes in market prices (other than interest or exchange rates).

The Group is exposed to market price risk arising from its investment in management fund. These instruments are classified as held for trading financial assets. The Group does not have exposure to commodity price risk.

#### Sensitivity analysis for market price risk

As at reporting date, if the quoted prices of the investment securities had been 0.25% higher/lower, with all other variables held constant, the Group and the Company's profit for the year would have been RM1,656,000 (2023: RM2,520,000) and RM1,253,000 (2023: RM2,296,000) higher/lower.

#### **(e) Foreign currency risk**

Foreign currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates.

#### **44. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES (CONT'D.)**

#### **(e) Foreign currency risk (cont'd.)**

Transactions in foreign operation are mainly denominated in the functional currency of the country it operates, and other foreign currency transactions are kept to an acceptable level. The Group's revenue that are denominated in foreign currencies are as disclosed in Note 46 to the financial statements.

To manage its risks, particularly interest rate risks and foreign currency risk, the Group has entered into cross-currency interest rate swap arrangements with financial institutions.

Included in the following statements of financial position captions of the Group and of the Company as at the reporting date are balances denominated in the following major foreign currencies:

#### **NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONT'D.)**  - 31 July 2024

#### **46. SEGMENT INFORMATION**

In the previous financial year, the sale of highway concessions was completed in October 2022 and water concession operation is reclassified from water and highway concessions to engineering and construction to better reflect their underlying business.

The Group reporting is organised and managed in two major business units. The segments are organised and managed to the nature of products and services, specific expertise and technologies requirements, which requires different business and marketing strategies.

The reportable segments are summarised as follows:

- (i) Engineering and construction the construction of highways and bridges, airfield facilities, railway, tunnel, water treatment plants, dams, general and trading services related to construction activities and the management of water supply; and
- (ii) Property development and club operations the development of residential and commercial properties and club operations.

The Group's chief operating decision maker monitors the operating results of its business segments separately for the purpose of making decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment. Segment performance is evaluated based on operating profit or loss which, in certain respects as explained in the table below, is measured differently from operating profit or loss in the consolidated financial statements.

Transfer pricing between operating segments are on an arm's length basis in a manner similar to transactions with third parties.

Section 230(1) of the CA 2016 provides that the 'fees' of the directors and 'any benefits' payable to the directors of a listed company and its subsidiaries shall be approved at a general meeting. Pursuant thereto, shareholders' approval shall be sought at this AGM for the payment of Directors' fees and benefits payable to the Non-Executive Directors of the Company under Resolutions 1 and 2.

#### i. Directors' Fees

Having considered the positioning of the Directors' fees over the past three (3) financial years **("FY")** from 2021 to 2023, the Board of Directors **("Board")**, on the recommendation of the Remuneration Committee, has proposed the Directors' fees for the Non-Executive Directors of the Company. The proposed fees are outlined on the right side of the table below:

| Directors' Fees<br>(as approved at AGMs) | FY2021    | FY2022                 | FY2023                 | Proposed for<br>FY2024<br>(approval to be<br>sought at<br>48th AGM) |

*@ Re-designation of Independent Non-Executive Chairman in FY2023*

*\* Re-designation of Audit Committee Chairman in FY2023*

*# Appointment of a new Independent Non-Executive Director during the financial years*

The total remuneration packages for Non-Executive Directors (including Independent Directors) are maintained for this financial year since their remuneration have been revised in FY2023 (see column "FY2023" in the above table).

Based on the benchmark study, the proposed fee structure differentiates the Independent Non-Executive Chairman's fee as 1.3 times that of a Non-Executive Director and 1.1 times that of Independent Non-Executive Directors with Board Committee membership. This differentiation has been assessed and found to be fair and equitable.

The payment of the Directors' fees totalling RM945,000/- in respect of the financial year ended 31 July 2024 will only be made if the proposed Resolution 1 is approved by the Company's shareholders at this AGM pursuant to Clause 116 of the Constitution and Section 230(1)(b) of the CA 2016.

# **NOTICE OF ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING**

ii. Directors' Remuneration amount.

The current Directors' remuneration (excluding Directors' fees) payable to the Non-Executive Directors of the Company comprises meeting allowances and benefits-in-kind (including a fixed allowance of RM100,000/- in respect of FY2025). At last year's 47th AGM, the benefits payable to the Non-Executive Directors of the Company from 8 December 2023 until this AGM on 5 December 2024 (12 months) was approved for an amount up to RM380,000.00. The utilisation of this approved amount as at 31 July 2024 is RM89,524/-. Based on the meeting schedule for the fourth quarter of 2024, including any Special Board and/or Board Commitee meetings, the anticipated expenditure for meeting allowances, the fixed allowance for the Independent Chairman, and other benefits for Non-Executive Directors is RM154,545. Hence, the expected total utilised amount would be approximately 64% of the approved

The Directors' remuneration (excluding Directors' fees) is summarised as follows:-

| Type of Allowance | Type of Meeting    | Independent<br>Non-Executive<br>Chairman | Independent<br>Non-Executive<br>Director | Non-Executive<br>Director |
|-------------------|--------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Meeting Allowance | Board of Directors | RM2,000                                  | RM2,000                                  | RM2,000                   |
| (per meeting)     | Board Committees   | RM2,000                                  | RM2,000                                  | RM2,000                   |
| Fixed Allowance   | N/A                | RM100,000/-                              | Nil                                      | Nil                       |

Directors' benefits payable also include insurance and other claimable benefits including reimbursable expenses incurred in the course of carrying out their duties as Company Directors, where applicable.

The total estimated remuneration for Non-Executive Directors (excluding Directors' Fees) is projected to remain at up to RM380,000/ from 6 December 2024 until the next AGM in 2025, pending shareholders' approval. This estimate considers several factors, including the number of scheduled meetings for the Board and its Committees, the participation of Non-Executive Directors in these meetings, and the Independent Chairman's fixed allowance for FY2025. Additionally, the remuneration allocation accommodates unforeseen circumstances, such as the appointment of additional Directors, unplanned Board and/or Board Committee meetings, and potential increases in premiums for Directors' and Officers' Liability insurance coverage.

The proposed Resolution 2, if passed, is to facilitate the payment of Directors' remuneration (excluding Directors' fees) as and when incurred. The Board opined that it is just and equitable for the Non-Executive Directors to receive such remuneration based on their discharge of responsibilities and the services they render to the Company.

In the event that the Directors' remuneration (excluding Directors' fees) paid during the above period exceeded the estimated amount sought at this AGM, shareholders' approval will be sought at the next AGM.

Any Non-Executive Director who is a shareholder of the Company will abstain from voting on Resolutions 1 and 2 at this AGM.

The remuneration of each Director for FY2024 is disclosed in Note 6 of the Financial Statements section of this Integrated Report 2024.

{222}------------------------------------------------

#### **c. Ordinary Resolutions 3 and 4**

For the purpose of determining the eligibility of the Directors to stand for re-election at this AGM and in line with Practice 5.1 of the Malaysian Code on Corporate Governance, the Nomination Committee has assessed each of the retiring Directors under Resolutions 3 and 4. The findings are as follows:-

- i. The Board continues to be effective with each of its member demonstrating commitment of time and energy to their duties as well as their abilities to act in the best interests of the Company in decision-making.
- ii. Their level of contribution to the Board's deliberations through their skills, experiences and strength in qualities meet the demands of the business in line with the strategy of the Company.

Based on the Board Effectiveness Report (2023/2024) prepared internally, all Directors met the performance criteria required of an effective and high-performance Board.

The Board, except for Puan Nazli Mohd Khir Johari, has assessed the independence of Puan Nazli as an Independent Non-Executive Director of the Company. The Board fully endorses the Nomination Committee's recommendation for the re-election of YBhg Dato' Ir Ha Tiing Tai and Puan Nazli Mohd Khir Johari as Directors of the Company, as they are eligible and, have expressed their willingness to stand for re-election at this AGM in accordance with Clause 105 of the Company's Constitution.

Any Director referred to in Resolutions 3 and 4 who is a shareholder of the Company will abstain from voting on the resolution in respect of his/her re-election at this AGM.

#### **d. Ordinary Resolution 5**

At the Board meeting held on 26 September 2024, the Board is satisfied that Ernst & Young PLT has met the relevant criteria prescribed under Paragraph 15.21 of the Main Market Listing Requirements of Bursa Securities, which was concluded through an assessment carried out by the Audit Committee on the suitability of Ernst & Young PLT and hence, supports the Audit Committee's recommendation to re-appoint Ernst & Young PLT as the Auditors of the Company.

#### **e. Ordinary Resolution 6**

Ordinary Resolution 6 if passed, will empower the Directors to issue shares of the Company up to a maximum of ten percent (10%) of the total number of issued shares of the Company for the time being, for any possible fund-raising activities for purposes of funding future investment projects, working capital, acquisitions and/or for strategic reasons. The approval is a renewal of a general mandate and is sought to provide flexibility and to avoid any delay and cost in convening a general meeting for such issuance of shares for fund raising activities, including placement of shares.

This authority will, unless revoked or varied at a general meeting, expire at the conclusion of the next AGM of the Company. At this juncture, there is no decision to issue new shares. Should there be a decision to issue new shares after the authorisation is sought, the Company will make an announcement of the actual purpose and utilisation of proceeds arising from such issuance of shares.

The Company did not issue any new shares under the general mandate which was approved at last year's 47th AGM.

# **f. Ordinary Resolution 7**

Shareholders are advised to refer to the Statement to Shareholders dated 7 November 2024, which is published on the Company's website at www.gamuda.com.my and Bursa Malaysia's website at www.bursamalaysia.com for further information.

#### **g. Ordinary Resolution 8**

Ordinary Resolution 8, if passed, will give authority to the Directors of the Company to allot and issue new Gamuda Shares pursuant to the Dividend Reinvestment Plan in respect of dividends declared after this AGM, and such authority shall expire at the conclusion of the
